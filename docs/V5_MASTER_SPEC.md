# Car Sales Simulator V5.0 — Master Technical Development Specification

**Status:** Draft 1. Phases 1-12 are merged; Phase 13 (realism: textures, lighting, interiors) code is written (see [Phase 13 status](#phase-13-status)). Nothing has been run in Unity yet: the release-candidate checks (2-week run, §11 budgets, Release Checklist) are to be done in the Editor.
**Baseline:** v4.0 "Open Town" (commit `e242293`): 95 runtime scripts, ~7,800 lines runtime C#, 2 editor generators, 1 installer
**Engine:** Unity 6 LTS, URP, C#
**Default region:** United Kingdom (GBP, V5C/MOT/write-off categories). Region rules are data, so other regions can be added later.

This document is the single blueprint for V5.0. It says what we keep, what we change, what we add, in which order,
how each piece is tested, and when a phase counts as finished. Implementation follows it phase by phase; when
reality disagrees with the spec, we update the spec first.

## 0. Ground rules

These rules apply to every phase. A change that breaks one of them is not merged.

| # | Rule | Why |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | **The game must stay playable at the end of every phase.** New systems are added next to old ones and switched over only after they work. | You have a working v4. We never trade it for a half-built v5. |
| R2 | **Never rename or move a `MonoBehaviour` or `ScriptableObject` class/file** that exists in v4. Add new ones instead and retire old ones later. | Unity links components by script GUID (stored in `.meta`). The zip-overwrite update workflow gives renamed/moved files new GUIDs and breaks every scene/prefab reference (that is exactly what caused the early `NullReferenceException`). |
| R3 | **Simulation logic lives in plain C# classes**, not in `MonoBehaviour`s. MonoBehaviours are thin adapters (input, visuals, physics). | Plain classes can be unit-tested without the Unity Editor running, and saved/loaded cleanly. |
| R4 | **Gameplay never references UI.** Systems publish events; UI listens. | Lets us rebuild any screen without touching gameplay. |
| R5 | **Every money movement goes through the Ledger** (`Ledger.Post`). No system edits cash directly. | Accounting, VAT, daily reports and tests all read the same records. |
| R6 | **Truth vs. knowledge:** a vehicle's real state and what the player *knows* about it are stored separately. | Inspections, auctions, private sellers and lies only work if the game knows the difference. |
| R7 | **All tunable numbers are data** (ScriptableObject configs), not constants in code. | Balancing without recompiling; Simulation Configurator edits them. |
| R8 | **Every save field has a version and a migration.** Old saves always load or fail with a readable message plus a backup. | Players lose trust after one corrupted save. |
| R9 | **Every imported asset has a licence record.** Release builds refuse assets with unknown or non-commercial licences. | Legal safety for a commercial game. |
| R10 | **Each phase ends with tests passing and a short manual play-test checklist done in the real Unity Editor.** | v4 was only compile-checked. That ends in Phase 0. |

---

## 1. Who does what

I write code, tools, data, docs and tests, and verify them by compiling against Unity's assemblies. I **cannot**
open the Unity Editor, see the game, buy or download store assets, or judge how driving feels. So each phase has
a hand-off:

| Task | Claude | You |
|---|---|---|
| Write scripts, editor tools, configs, tests | ✅ | review |
| Compile-check against Unity assemblies | ✅ | — |
| Run in the Unity Editor, play-test, report Console errors/screenshots | — | ✅ (essential, every phase) |
| Run the Unity Test Runner (EditMode/PlayMode) | write the tests | ✅ click *Run All*, send failures |
| Choose/buy/download 3D assets (Sketchfab, KitBash3D, Asset Store...) | recommend, write importers | ✅ (accounts, purchases, licences) |
| Tune driving feel, visuals, balancing | propose values | ✅ judge, report |
| GitHub repository | commit locally, push once the repo exists and the Claude GitHub App can access it | ✅ create `car-for-sale-sim` (empty) |

---

## 2. Decisions that differ from the audit

I agree with almost all of the audit. These are the places where I'd do it differently, and why.

| Topic | Audit proposal | This spec | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Order** | Asset Studio first | **Stabilise → Core/Save/Tests → Vehicle Framework → Asset Studio** | Asset Studio's most valuable job ("make this downloaded car drivable") needs the Vehicle Framework to exist first. Without it, an imported car has nothing to be set up *for*. |
| **Folder layout** | Move everything to `Assets/_Project/...` | **Keep `Assets/CarSales/`**, add new module folders beside `Scripts/` | Rule R2. A mass move breaks every reference in your existing project. |
| **"Paste any URL" importer** | Universal downloader | **Provider connectors only where an official API exists (Sketchfab, Poly Haven), plus a watched "Drop" folder and drag-and-drop for everything else** | KitBash3D, CGTrader, Fab, Quixel and the Asset Store have no public download API for this; scraping them breaks their terms. You download those yourself and Asset Studio takes it from there. |
| **Automatic LODs** | Always generated | **Use the model's own LODs, Unity 6.2+ import-time Mesh LOD where available, otherwise the MIT-licensed UnityMeshSimplifier** | Unity has no built-in LOD generator on older 6.x versions. |
| **Competitor dealerships** | Full AI businesses walking around | **Simulated "off-screen" first** (stock, prices, market share), physical competitor lots later | 90% of the gameplay effect for 10% of the cost. |
| **Traffic AI** | Phase 7 full traffic | **Lane graph + simple followers + traffic lights**, no overtaking in V5.0 | Overtaking/parking AI is a project on its own; it can come in V5.x. |
| **Multiplayer** | Optional | **Out of scope for V5.0** | Retrofitting networking into a single-player sim means rewriting most systems. |
| **Real UK legal processes** | Detailed | **Simulated through menus and data**, never presented as real legal/financial advice | As the audit itself notes. |

## 3. Target architecture

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PRESENTATION (CarSales.Runtime)                                              │
│  UI screens · HUD · Phone OS · World objects · Vehicle controllers · Audio   │
│  (MonoBehaviours: read state, send commands, listen to events)               │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ SIMULATION (CarSales.Sim — plain C#, unit-tested)                            │
│  Vehicles · Inspection · Workshop · Documents · Market · Auction · Customers  │
│  Staff · Business/Finance · World sim (weather, competitors, calendar)       │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│  EventBus · Ledger · GameClock · ServiceRegistry · Config · Region · RNG     │
│  Save (modules, versions, migrations, atomic files, backups)                 │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 EDITOR (CarSales.Editor + CarSales.Studio.Editor)
  Setup Wizard · Asset Studio · Vehicle Studio · World Builder · Sim Configurator
```

Dependencies only point **downward**. `CarSales.Runtime` (the v4 code) references `CarSales.Sim` and `CarSales.Core`,
never the other way round. Over the phases, logic moves *down* out of v4 MonoBehaviours into Sim classes, and
the MonoBehaviours become adapters (the "strangler" approach: the old code keeps working while it is replaced piece by piece).

### 3.1 How systems talk

| Mechanism | Used for | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Commands** (method calls on a service) | Asking a system to do something | `Auction.PlaceBid(lotId, buyerId, amount)` |
| **Events** (`EventBus.Publish<T>`) | Telling everyone something happened | `LotSold { lotId, buyerId, hammerPrice }` |
| **Queries** (read-only properties) | UI reading state | `Inventory.CarsIn(LocationId)` |
| **ServiceRegistry** | Finding a service | `Services.Get<IAuctionEngine>()` |

`CarSalesServices` (v4) stays as a static façade and forwards to the registry, so old code keeps compiling.

---

### 4.1 Packages added in V5.0

| Package | Id | Used by | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| Newtonsoft Json | `com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json` | Save v5 (dictionaries, polymorphism, versioning) | 1 |
| Test Framework | `com.unity.test-framework` | All tests | 1 |
| glTFast | `com.unity.cloud.gltfast` | GLB/glTF import (Sketchfab downloads) | 3 |
| Splines | `com.unity.splines` | Roads, traffic lanes, auction lanes | 7 |
| Cinemachine | `com.unity.cinemachine` | Driving camera, cinematic menu, inspection camera | 2 |

The installer (`CarSalesDependencyInstaller`) gains these. We also start shipping **`Packages/manifest.json`**
so a fresh project gets the right packages without the dialog.

---

## 5. Fate of every v4 script

**Keep** = unchanged or trivial edits · **Modify** = same class, new behaviour · **Wrap** = becomes a thin adapter
over a new Sim service · **Retire** = kept compiling for old scenes, unused once its replacement passes its tests.

### Core
| Script | Fate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CarSalesServices | Wrap | Static façade forwarding to `ServiceRegistry`; adds new services. |

| MarketplaceManager | Wrap | Becomes the *Online* channel of `SourcingService`. |
| AuctionManager | Retire | Replaced by `AuctionEngine` (§6.9). |
| TowService | Wrap | Becomes `TransportService` (timed jobs, own truck/trailer later). |
| TestDriveManager | Modify | Becomes the player vehicle session (enter/exit/park/fuel) and delegates driving to `IVehicleDriver`. |
| DayCycleManager | Modify | Uses `GameClock`; adds weekday/calendar, weekly wages, VAT quarters. Sleep/pass-out rules unchanged. |
| DayNightLighting | Modify | Weather (clouds, rain, fog, wet roads). |

---

## 6. Module specifications

### 6.1 Core

| Type | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `EventBus` | `Subscribe<T>(Action<T>)`, `Unsubscribe`, `Publish<T>(T)`. Events are small structs. No string-keyed events. |
| `ServiceRegistry` | `Register<T>(T)`, `Get<T>()`, `TryGet<T>()`. Reset on scene unload. |
| `GameClock` | Game time (`Day`, `Hour`, `Weekday`, `Week`, `Quarter`), speed, pause; fires `HourPassed`, `DayStarted`, `WeekEnded`, `QuarterEnded`. Wraps DayCycleManager's time. |
| `Ledger` | Append-only list of `Transaction { id, day, hour, amount, category, accountFrom, accountTo, vatAmount, vatScheme, refType, refId, memo }`. Balances, filters, P&L. |
| `ConfigRegistry` | Loads all `ConfigAsset`s (economy, auction, customers, staff, weather...) and exposes them by type. |
| `RegionProfile` (SO) | Currency (£), number/date format, units, VAT rate, MOT rules (first test at 3 years, yearly), plate format, write-off categories, typical fees. |
| `SimRandom` | Seeded RNG per subsystem (deterministic tests, reproducible bug reports). |

**Ledger categories** (enum `TxCategory`): VehiclePurchase, VehicleSale, AuctionBuyerFee, AuctionSellerFee, StorageFee,
Transport, Parts, Labour, Detailing, Fuel, Documents (history checks, MOT, V5C), Advertising, Wages, Rent, Utilities,
BusinessRates, Insurance, InsuranceClaim, LoanDrawdown, LoanRepayment, LoanInterest, FinanceCommission, VAT,
PropertyPurchase, PropertyIncome, Fines, Upgrades, Other.

**Core events (initial set):** `MoneyChanged`, `TransactionPosted`, `VehicleAcquired`, `VehicleStateChanged`,
`VehicleSold`, `VehicleMoved`, `InspectionCompleted`, `FaultDiscovered`, `JobQueued`, `JobCompleted`, `LotOpened`,
`BidPlaced`, `Outbid`, `LotSold`, `LotUnsold`, `InvoiceIssued`, `InvoiceOverdue`, `CustomerArrived`,
`CustomerLeft`, `ReviewPosted`, `EmployeeHired`, `WeatherChanged`, `DayEnded`, `GameSaved`.

### 6.2 Save system

**File layout** (`Application.persistentDataPath/saves/`):
```
slot_1/
  save.json        ← current
  save.json.bak1   ← previous (rotated, keep 3)
  save.json.bak2
  save.json.bak3
  meta.json        ← small: day, cash, playtime, screenshot path (for the load menu)
  thumb.png
```

**Envelope:**
```json
{ "format": "CSS-SAVE", "version": 5, "gameVersion": "5.0.0", "savedAtUtc": "...",
  "checksum": "sha256 of payload", "modules": { "economy": {...}, "inventory": {...}, "auction": {...} } }
```

| Feature | Spec |
|---|---|
| Modules | Each system implements `ISaveModule { string Key; int Version; JToken Save(); void Load(JToken, int version); }`. A missing module loads defaults (new systems never break old saves). |
| Atomic write | Serialise → write `save.json.tmp` → flush → rotate backups → `File.Replace(tmp, save.json, bak1)`. A crash mid-write never leaves a half file. |
| Validation | Envelope format, checksum, per-module schema checks (e.g. no negative fuel, unique VINs, car ids exist). Invalid values are clamped and logged. |
| Recovery | Load fails → try bak1 → bak2 → bak3 → tell the player which backup loaded and the date. |
| Migration | `ISaveMigration { int From; JObject Migrate(JObject) }` chain. **v4 → v5** reads the old `SaveData` JSON: converts `parts[6]` into components, generates VIN/registration/documents for existing cars, cash → opening ledger balance. |
| Autosave | On sleep (as v4), every 15 game-hours, before entering an auction, on quit. Never while a menu transaction is half-done (`SaveBlocker` scopes). |
| Slots | 3 manual slots + 1 autosave slot. |
| Tests | Round-trip every module; migrate a fixture v4 save; corrupt file → backup loads; interrupted write simulation. |

#### 6.3.1 Component catalogue (V5.0: 30 components, 10 groups)

| Group (v4 part it feeds) | Components |
|---|---|
| Engine (Engine) | Engine block/internals, Cylinder head & gasket, Timing belt/chain, Oil & filter, Cooling system/radiator, Ignition/glow plugs, Intake & turbo |
| Transmission (Engine) | Gearbox, Clutch (manual) / Torque converter (auto), Driveshafts & CV joints |
| Battery & charging (Electronics) | 12V battery, Alternator, Starter motor |
| Electronics (Electronics) | ECU & sensors, Lights, Infotainment & dash, Wiring |
| Brakes (Brakes) | Pads (front/rear), Discs (front/rear), Brake fluid & lines |
| Suspension & steering (Brakes) | Shock absorbers, Springs, Bushes & arms, Steering rack, Alignment |
| Tyres (Tires) | 4 × tyre (tread mm, age, damage), Spare/repair kit |
| Exhaust (Engine) | Exhaust system, Catalytic converter / DPF |
| Body (Body) | Panels (bonnet, boot, roof, 4 doors, 2 wings, 2 quarters, 2 bumpers), Paint, Windscreen & glass, Rust |
| Interior (Interior) | Seats, Dashboard & trim, Carpets & headliner, Odour/cleanliness |

EVs and hybrids swap engine components for: Traction battery (state of health %), Electric motor, Inverter,
Charging port/on-board charger, Thermal management. Each component definition (`ComponentDefinition` SO) has:
`id, group, weightInValue, applicablePowertrains, wearPerKm, wearPerYear, faultTable, repairJobs`.

#### 6.3.2 Component state
```
ComponentState { health 0–100, wear 0–100, faults: List<FaultInstance>, lastServicedKm, replacedOnDay, partQuality }
FaultInstance  { faultId, severity 0–1, discovered=false (truth only), progressPerDay }
```

#### 6.3.3 Fault catalogue (`FaultDefinition` SO), first 40 faults

Each fault: `id, component, symptom text, DTC code (optional), visibility mask, severity range, value impact,
progression, safety-critical (MOT fail), repair jobs that fix it`.

**Visibility mask** decides which inspection finds it: `Visual | Interior | UnderBonnet | Scanner | RoadTest | Lift | History`.
Example rows:

| Fault | Component | Found by | DTC | MOT |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Worn front pads | Pads F | Lift, RoadTest (squeal) | — | fail < 1.5 mm |
| Misfire cylinder 2 | Ignition | Scanner, RoadTest | P0302 | — |
| Head gasket leak | Cylinder head | UnderBonnet (mayo cap), RoadTest (overheat) | — | — |
| Clutch slipping | Clutch | RoadTest | — | — |
| Clocked mileage | (history) | History, Interior (wear vs. odometer) | — | — |
| Previous Cat N repair | (history) | History, Visual (paint mismatch) | — | — |
| Corroded sill | Rust | Lift | — | fail |
| Battery weak | Battery | Scanner, won't start in cold | — | — |

#### 6.3.4 Vehicle states
`Listed (marketplace/auction, not owned)` → `Purchased/AwaitingPayment` → `AwaitingCollection` → `InTransit` →
`InStock` → `InWorkshop` / `InDetailing` / `InMOT` → `ReadyForSale` → `Listed (forecourt/online)` →
`Reserved (deposit)` → `Sold/AwaitingHandover` → `Delivered`. Also `Personal`, `Scrapped`.

### 6.4 Vehicle physics (Vehicle Framework)

| Part | Spec |
|---|---|
| `IVehicleDriver` | Interface both controllers implement: `SetInput(throttle, brake, steer, handbrake)`, `Speed`, `Rpm`, `Gear`, `IsGrounded`, `OnImpact`. TestDriveManager talks only to this. |
| `WheelVehicleController` | `Rigidbody` + 4× `WheelCollider` (extensible to 6). Centre of mass from profile. Visual wheels follow `GetWorldPose`. |
| `EngineModel` | Torque curve (AnimationCurve, Nm vs rpm), idle/redline, inertia, engine braking; health scales torque (misfire = torque dips). |
| `GearboxModel` | Automatic (default): ratios, final drive, up/down shift rpm, shift time, kick-down, reverse/neutral/park. Manual mode optional. Clutch health → slip. |
| `ElectricDriveModel` | Flat torque to base speed, power limit, single ratio, regen braking, battery kWh → range. |
| Brakes | Front/rear bias, brake torque from health; **ABS** (release when wheel slip > threshold), handbrake on rear axle. |
| Assists | **TCS** (cut torque on drive-wheel slip), **ESC** (light yaw correction brake), speed-sensitive steering, anti-roll bars per axle. All toggleable. |
| Tyres | Forward/sideways friction curves from profile × tread × weather wetness × surface. |
| Suspension | Spring/damper/travel from profile × shock health (worn shocks = bouncy). |
| Damage | `DamageReceiver`: collision impulse + contact point → zone (front/rear/left/right/roof) → panel health, paint, and chance to damage radiator/suspension/steering alignment. Optional mesh deformation (vertex push, capped). |
| Fuel/energy | Consumption from engine load (BSFC-lite): L/100km at cruise from the definition × load factor. EV kWh/100km. |
| Profiles | `VehiclePhysicsProfile` SO per class: City hatch, Family hatch, Saloon, Estate, SUV, Pickup, Van, Sports, Luxury, EV hatch. |
| Camera | Cinemachine chase + bonnet + interior camera; look-back. |
| Audio | Engine loop pitched by rpm/load (2–4 layers), tyre skid, impact, indicator, horn. |

**Arcade fallback:** `GameSettings.drivingModel = Arcade | Realistic`. If a car has no wheel setup (e.g. an
unprocessed import), it falls back to Arcade automatically.

### 6.5 Inspection and knowledge

`PlayerKnowledge` stores, per component: `knownHealthBand (unknown / estimate ±x / exact)`, `knownFaults`, and per
document `known/unknown/verified`. UI always shows the **knowledge**, never the truth.

| Method | Where | Time | Cost | Reveals |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Walk-around (visual) | anywhere | 2 min | free | Visual faults, panel/paint damage, tyre tread estimate |
| Interior check | sitting in car | 2 min | free | Interior, warning lights, odometer vs. wear |
| Under-bonnet | bonnet open | 3 min | free | Leaks, belts, fluid levels, mayonnaise oil cap |
| OBD scanner | needs scanner tool (upgrade) | 1 min | free after purchase | Stored DTCs → Scanner faults |
| Road test | drive it | as long as you drive | fuel | RoadTest faults (noises, vibration, slipping, pulling) — **only noticed when the condition happens** (e.g. clutch slip under hard throttle in high gear) |
| Lift inspection | workshop | 15 min | free in own workshop | Brakes, suspension, exhaust, rust, underbody |
| History check (HPI-style) | phone/computer | instant | £15 | Write-off cat., outstanding finance, stolen, mileage anomalies, plate changes |
| Full inspection | workshop staff | 1 h | £120 (or staff time) | Everything except intermittent faults |

**Accuracy:** the player's/employee's *inspection skill* sets how exact the estimate is and the chance to
notice a marginal fault. Auction condition reports are another knowledge source with their own reliability (§6.9).

**Inspection Mode (UI/gameplay):** in first person, the car shows interaction sockets (door, bonnet, boot, wheels,
dash). Each completed check ticks a checklist and writes knowledge. Mouse-over on a revealed fault shows
symptom + estimated repair cost.

### 6.6 Workshop, parts and repairs

| Type | Spec |
|---|---|
| `PartDefinition` SO | id, name, category, fits (component id + platform/category), quality tiers: **Used** (cheap, 50–80% health), **Aftermarket**, **OEM** (best); price per tier; supplier lead time. |
| `PartsInventory` | Stock per part/tier, location (workshop storage), reorder. |
| Suppliers | Local motor factor (same day, normal price), online (next morning, −15%), breaker's yard (used parts, random stock). |
| `RepairJobDefinition` SO | id, fixes (component/faults), required parts, labour hours, station, skill, result health per part tier. E.g. *Replace front pads & discs*: 2 pads, 2 discs, 1.2 h, Mechanical bay. |
| Stations | Mechanical bay (lift), Diagnostic bay, Tyre machine + balancer, Alignment rig, Body bay, Paint booth, Detailing bay, MOT bay. Each is a `WorkStation` in a Site; owned via dealership upgrades. |
| `WorkshopService` | Job queue per station; jobs advance with `GameClock` × worker skill; parts reserved on start; ledger posts Parts + Labour (labour = staff wage share, or external garage rate £65/h). |
| Doing it yourself | Player can perform a job at a station: short interaction (hold to unbolt/fit sequence) instead of waiting — faster, free labour, small fail chance at low skill. |
| External garage | Town Mechanic Workshop (v4) remains: pay retail rate, no parts needed. |
| Results | Component health/faults updated → value recalculated → `JobCompleted` event; service book entry written. |

### 6.7 Documents and history (UK profile)

| Document | Data | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **V5C logbook** | keeper count, registered keeper, present yes/no | Missing V5C: −25% value, some buyers refuse. Apply for replacement: £25, arrives in 5 days. |
| **MOT** | expiry date, mileage at test, advisories, fails | Cars > 3 years need MOT. Expired MOT: can't be test-driven on road by customers; −10% value. MOT test at MOT bay or town garage (£54.85 cap in UK; configurable). |
| **MOT history** | list of past tests with mileage | Reveals mileage anomalies and recurring problems. |
| **Service history** | stamps (full/partial/none), last service km | Full history +5–8% value, persona-dependent. |
| **Keys** | count (0–2) | 1 key −2%; 0 keys: can't drive; locksmith job. |
| **Vehicle tax** | simulated status only | Must be taxed to drive on public roads (simple on/off fee per day of use). |
| **History check flags** | Write-off **Cat A/B/S/N**, outstanding finance, stolen, imported, plate change | Cat S −30–40%, Cat N −15–25%. Outstanding finance: car can be repossessed (loss!) unless settled. Stolen: police seize (loss). |
| **Paperwork on sale** | invoice, V5C transfer, warranty (optional), history pack | Generated as in-game documents; completeness affects review score. |

Plates and VINs: generated with the region's format (UK `AB12 CDE` age identifier from first-registration date;
17-char VIN with valid check digit style). Unique across the save.

### 6.8 Market model and sourcing

**MarketModel** (one per save):
- Price index per `CarDefinition` (and per category) starting at its base value, random walk ±0.5%/day,
  mean-reverting, plus **seasonal** factors (convertibles +8% in May–Aug, 4×4/SUV +5% in Nov–Feb), fuel-price effect
  (EV/hybrid demand), and **supply/demand**: every sale in town lowers demand briefly; low supply raises prices.
- Competitor dealers (off-screen) buy from the same pool and list at their own margin, so player prices are
  compared against them.

**Sourcing channels** (`SourcingService`):

| Channel | Price vs. market | Risk | Process |
|---|---|---|---|
| Private sellers (classifieds) | −10 to −25% | Medium (lies, hidden faults, outstanding finance) | Ad → message/call → appointment at a house in town (seller NPC + car spawned there) → inspect/test drive → haggle → pay → V5C handover → drive/tow it away |
| Online marketplace (v4) | −5 to −15% | Medium | Listing → seller report → buy → delivery fee/collection |
| Dealer trade / wholesale | −15 to −30% | Low–medium | Weekly offers of 3–8 cars, bulk discount, must take the batch |
| Trade-ins | negotiated | Low (you inspect it on the forecourt) | Customer offers their car as part payment (§6.10) |
| Dealer auctions | −15 to −35% | Medium | §6.9 |
| Salvage auctions | −40 to −80% | High (Cat S/N, non-runners, flood/fire) | §6.9 |
| Fleet/lease returns | −10 to −20% | Low (full history, high mileage) | Auction lots in batches |
| Repossessions | −20 to −35% | Medium (no keys/V5C sometimes) | Auction lots |

### 6.9 Auction engine

One engine (`AuctionEngine`, Sim layer) drives both the **physical auction hall** and the **online terminal**.
UI layers only display it and send bids.

**Entities**
```
AuctionVenue    id, siteId (physical yard) or online, buyer fee table, storage fee/day, collection days
AuctionEvent    id, venue, type (Dealer|Salvage|Fleet|Online timed), date, start hour, lots[]
Lot             lotNo, vehicle (CarInstance in Listed state), reserve (hidden), startPrice, conditionReport,
                keys, starts, drives, category, damage text, MOT, V5C present, buyNow (optional), status
ConditionReport grade 1–5, listed damage, mileage (claimed), notes; reliability depends on venue type
BuyerAccount    buyerNo, registered venues, deposit held, limit, invoices, watchlist, stats
Invoice         lot, hammer, buyer premium, fixed fees, VAT on fees, total, dueDay, paid, collection deadline
Bidder (AI)     archetype, budget, target categories, margin, risk appetite, max lots/day
```

**Event flow**
1. Calendar: venues publish events 3–7 days ahead (phone/computer **Auction calendar**). Physical yard opens viewing
   the day before and on the morning.
2. **Register** (once per venue): pay a refundable deposit (e.g. £500), receive a **buyer number**.
3. **Browse catalogue / watchlist**; walk the yard: each lot is a physical car on a numbered bay with its
   condition report on the windscreen. Normal inspection methods apply (scanner, under-bonnet...), **no road test** (yard only lets you start the engine if `starts`).
4. **Set a max bid** (proxy bidding for online/absent) or bid live.
5. **Live sale** (physical): lots run through the hall in order; auctioneer calls "starting at...", increments,
   "going once / going twice / sold" with a short timer (e.g. 4 s per call, resets on each bid). Player bids
   by raising the paddle (E) in the hall. Reserve not met → "provisional bid" → seller accepts/declines within the day.
6. **Online timed**: lots end at staggered times; a bid in the last 2 minutes extends the lot by 2 minutes (soft close).
7. **Win** → `Invoice` issued. Payment due in 2 days (ledger posts VehiclePurchase + AuctionBuyerFee + VAT on fee).
   Overdue → £50/day + reputation loss; 5 days → sale cancelled, deposit kept.
8. **Collection**: free for 3 days, then storage £15/day. Collect by driving it (if drives + taxed), tow truck,
   or your own transporter (staff driver). Vehicle state: `AwaitingCollection` at the venue.

**Bid increments (configurable):** <£1,000: £50 · £1,000–4,999: £100 · £5,000–9,999: £250 · £10,000+: £500.

**Buyer premium (example dealer auction):** tiered table, e.g. £0–999 → £150; £1,000–2,999 → £250; £3,000–4,999 → £350;
… plus £20 internet fee for online bids. VAT 20% is charged on fees.

**AI bidder maximum** (§8.3) uses expected resale, estimated repairs (from the condition report, with archetype-specific
optimism), fees, transport and target margin, plus noise. Archetypes: Private buyer, Small trader, Franchise dealer
(only good grades), Exporter (likes Japanese/4×4, high mileage OK), Scrap/breaker (salvage value floor), Mechanic
(likes mechanical faults, avoids bodywork), Large dealer group (bulk, low margins).

**Risks built in:** report omits a fault (lower reliability at salvage auctions), "keys: 1" turns out missing,
non-runner that only needs a battery (opportunity!), mileage "unverified", outstanding finance cleared by the
auction (dealer auctions guarantee title, salvage auctions don't).

### 6.10 Customers and sales

**BuyerPersona** (SO): budget range, category preferences, weights for
`price, condition, mileage, brand, age, history, economy, features, docs`, knowledge level (how well they spot
faults), haggling skill, patience, trade-in chance, finance chance, review harshness.

Initial personas: Budget hunter, First-time buyer, Family buyer, Commuter (economy/EV), Enthusiast (sports, knows
mechanics), Luxury buyer, Mechanically savvy haggler, Impatient buyer, Trader (buys to resell, lowballs).

**Car scoring** (utility, §8.4): each customer scores every listed car they look at; they go to the best ones,
inspect, maybe compare 2–3, then talk to a salesperson (player or staff).

**Behaviour** (`BuyerBrain`, utility-driven state machine replacing the v4 coroutine FSM):
Arrive (parking/walk-in) → Browse (walk between cars, look) → Inspect (open door/bonnet, sit inside, kneel at tyres —
animation slots on `CarDisplay` sockets) → Compare → Ask (dialogue: mileage? history? MOT? last service? "any
problems?" — lying is possible and can come back as a bad review) → Test drive request → Negotiate (with trade-in /
finance options) → Paperwork & deposit → Collection (same day or reserved for a later day) → Review → Leave.

**Customer test drives:** requires valid MOT/tax and insurance (trade plates upgrade). Options: player rides along
(customer drives on a route via `TrafficLane` waypoints) or employee goes. Faults with RoadTest visibility may
be noticed by the customer → negotiation penalty.

**Trade-in:** customer's car is generated (persona-appropriate), you inspect it on the forecourt, the trade-in value
is part of the deal. **Finance:** customer applies; approval chance from credit score and deposit; dealer earns a
commission (ledger: FinanceCommission); the lender pays the dealer.

**After-sale:** warranty claims (optional 3-month warranty sold as add-on), complaints if a hidden fault you knew about
appears (rep hit), returns within a configurable window.

**CRM:** persistent `CustomerRecord` (name, persona, contact, visits, cars viewed, purchases, satisfaction, leads).
Leads come from online listings and walk-ins; follow-ups by phone can bring them back. Repeat customers return
when their car "ages out" (simulated).

### 6.11 Staff and jobs

| Role | Does | Key skill |
|---|---|---|
| Salesperson | Greets customers, answers questions, negotiates within limits you set (min margin %) | Sales, Negotiation |
| Mechanic | Takes jobs from the workshop board | Mechanical, Diagnostics, Bodywork |
| Detailer | Washing, valeting, paint correction | Detailing |
| Driver | Collections, deliveries, test-drive escort | Driving |
| Receptionist | Raises customer spawn conversion, handles calls/CRM | Admin |
| Manager | Bonus to all staff morale/productivity at one site | Management |

Each employee: skills (0–100), experience (grows), wage (£/week), shift pattern, morale, reliability (sick days).
**Job board** (`JobSystem`): every task is a `Job { type, site, requirements, duration, priority }`; staff pick the
highest-priority job they're qualified for. Player can assign manually. Wages paid on `WeekEnded` via the Ledger.
Hiring through a recruitment page with 3–6 candidates per week.

### 6.12 Business and finance

| System | V5.0 scope |
|---|---|
| Accounts | P&L (day/week/quarter), cash flow, per-car profit (purchase + all costs vs. sale), stock value, ageing stock (days in stock). |
| VAT | Configurable: **Margin scheme** for used cars (VAT = margin × 1/6 at 20%), standard VAT on fees/parts/labour. Quarterly VAT return on `QuarterEnded`; late payment fine. |
| Bank | Business current account, overdraft (limit by credit rating), loans (term, APR, monthly repayment), statements. |
| Insurance | Business policy (premises, stock, public liability, trade plates/motor trade). Premium by stock value, claims history, security level. Events: theft, vandalism, forecourt damage → claim minus excess. |
| Running costs | Rent, utilities (per site size), business rates, cleaning, security (CCTV/alarm upgrades lower theft risk). |
| Marketing | Campaigns (local paper, online ads, social, signage, open day): cost per day, effect on footfall and persona mix, diminishing returns. Listing quality (photos, description, price vs. market) affects online leads. |
| Reputation | Review stars (average of recent reviews) + legacy reputation number; affects footfall and prices customers accept. |
| Competitors | 3–5 named off-screen dealers with stock, pricing style and reputation; appear in a **Competitor research** page (their listings vs. yours). |
| Dealership levels | 1 Small forecourt → 2 Small showroom → 3 Medium dealership → 4 Large with workshop → 5 Premium → 6 Multi-site group. Unlocks: capacity, staff slots, stations, personas (luxury buyers need level 5 or the Luxury Lane site). |
| Analytics | Sales per persona/category, average margin, days to sell, lead conversion. |

### 6.13 World simulation

| System | V5.0 scope |
|---|---|
| Calendar | Weekdays (Sunday shorter hours/quieter), seasons, bank holidays (busy). |
| Weather | States: Clear, Cloudy, Overcast, Rain, Heavy rain, Fog; Markov transitions per hour; affects lighting, wet roads (grip, puddle shader), customer footfall (−30% in rain), car wash demand. Snow out of scope for V5.0. |
| Fuel prices | Daily random walk; affects fuel cost and EV demand. |
| Traffic | Spline **lane graph** from World Builder; `TrafficCar` follows lanes with gap keeping, stops at lights/junction give-way, speed limits; density by time of day; despawn out of view. Collision → stops, hazard lights. |
| Pedestrians | NavMesh agents walking between sidewalk points and shop entrances; some become dealership customers. |
| Random events | Police checks (no tax/MOT fine), breakdowns of your stock (if a fault progresses), road works, open days, theft attempts. |

### 6.14 UI design system

#### 6.14.1 Foundations
- `UITheme` SO: colour tokens (bg, surface 1–3, primary, accent, success, warning, danger, text 1–3, outline),
  font assets (heading/body/mono numbers), type scale (12/14/16/20/24/32/48), spacing scale (4/8/12/16/24/32),
  corner radii, shadow, motion durations (fast 120 ms, normal 200 ms, slow 320 ms), light/dark variants.
- Keep **code-built uGUI** (it works and avoids broken references), but every value comes from the theme.
- Component library (in `UIFactory`): Button (primary/secondary/ghost/danger, icon), Card, Table (sortable,
  virtualised rows for big lists), Tabs, Segmented control, Modal, Drawer, Toast, Badge/Chip, Field/Input/Dropdown,
  Slider, Stepper/progress checklist, Timeline, Stat tile, Sparkline/mini chart, Empty state, Skeleton loader.
- Screen stack with transitions (fade+slide), Back (Esc / gamepad B), gamepad/keyboard focus navigation,
  UI scale setting (80–130%), colour-blind-safe status colours (icons + text, never colour alone).

#### 6.14.2 Screens (new or redesigned)
Main menu (cinematic camera over the town, save slots with thumbnails) · HUD (minimal: clock/weather, cash,
GPS strip, speed/gear/fuel when driving, contextual prompts) · Dealer Computer desktop (apps: Stock, Marketplace,
Auctions, Workshop, CRM, Accounts, Bank, Staff, Marketing, Competitors, Real Estate, Settings) · Vehicle file
(tabs: Overview, Condition, Documents, History, Costs, Listing) · Inspection mode overlay · Workshop board
(kanban per station) · Parts shop · Auction terminal (calendar, catalogue, live lot, watchlist, invoices) ·
Auction hall HUD (current lot, bid, increments, paddle prompt, timer) · Listing editor (photos, price helper vs.
market & competitors, description) · Negotiation 2.0 (offer slider, trade-in card, finance card, customer mood) ·
Paperwork/handover · CRM · Accounts/P&L · Staff · Marketing · Map (full screen, filters, routes) · Phone OS.

#### 6.14.3 Phone OS
Lock/home screen with app grid, notifications, status bar (time, battery-style energy). Apps: Messages, Calls,
Auctions, Marketplace, Bank, Map/GPS, Tow & Transport, Taxi, Calendar, Contacts (CRM), Camera (photograph cars for
listings), Settings. Opens with P; usable while walking (not while driving except hands-free calls).

### 6.15 Audio
Mixer groups (Master/Music/SFX/Ambience/Vehicles/UI/Voice), clip library SO with replaceable slots (procedural clips
from v4 stay as fallbacks), vehicle engine layers, ambience by zone (street, showroom, workshop, auction hall with
auctioneer chant loop), rain, UI sounds.

---

## 7. Editor tools

All tools live under **Tools → Car Sales Studio** and share one `StudioDatabase` (asset records, licences, templates).

### 7.1 Aurex Asset Studio

**Sources**

| Source | How | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Local file / folder | Drag & drop or file picker | FBX, OBJ, GLB/glTF (glTFast), DAE, .blend (needs Blender installed — Unity converts it), textures, HDRI |
| Drop folder | `Assets/CarSales/Art/_Drop/` watched by an `AssetPostprocessor` | For KitBash3D, Fab, CGTrader, Quixel/Megascans, TurboSquid downloads you make yourself |
| Unity Asset Store | Install via Package Manager → **Scan packages** button lists new prefabs/models | |
| Sketchfab | Official Data API (search) + Download API (glTF/GLB zip), with **your** API token (stored in EditorPrefs, never in the project) | Licence and author read from the API; only downloadable models; attribution saved |
| Poly Haven | Public API for HDRIs, textures, models (CC0) | Check its API usage terms before shipping |

**Pipeline** (each step has a result panel and can be re-run):
1. **Ingest** → copies into `Art/<Category>/<AssetName>/Source/`, creates `AssetRecord` + `LicenceRecord` (licence
   step can't be skipped; *Unknown* is allowed for prototyping but flagged).
2. **Analyse** → bounds, likely unit scale (compares bounds with the expected size of the chosen category, e.g. car
   length 3.5–5.5 m, door height ~2.1 m), up/forward axis, mesh/sub-mesh/tri counts, materials, missing textures,
   rig/animations, existing LODs, duplicate check (hash of mesh data).
3. **Normalise** → import settings (scale factor, axis conversion, read/write only when needed), wrapper root
   with pivot at ground centre, +Z forward.
4. **Materials** → remap to URP Lit (base/normal/metal-smoothness/AO/emission channels by name heuristics:
   `_albedo, _basecolor, _n, _normal, _rough, _metal, _ao`), texture max-size and compression presets, flags
   missing textures.
5. **Colliders** → box / compound boxes / convex hulls / mesh collider (static only) by category.
6. **LODs** → existing LODs → LODGroup; else Unity Mesh LOD (if available) or simplifier; screen-size thresholds by category.
7. **Classify & integrate** → category templates:
   - **Vehicle:** wheel detection (name regex `wheel|tyre|tire|rim` + `fl/fr/rl/rr|front|rear|left|right`, then
     geometry heuristic: four similar near-cylindrical meshes near the bottom corners), door/bonnet/boot detection
     by name; **manual correction screen** (click mesh → assign role) when detection is unsure. Generates:
     prefab with `Rigidbody`, `WheelVehicleController`, `WheelCollider`s sized from the wheel meshes, `CarVisual`
     paint slots (choose which materials are paint), interaction sockets, lights, exhaust/audio points, damage
     zones, and a `CarDefinition` draft for Vehicle Studio.
   - **Building:** choose function (Dealership, Workshop, Auction hall, Car wash, Fuel station, Home, Office, Shop,
     Decorative); mark entrances, floors (NavMesh walkable), interior volumes; adds `Site` + `SiteEntrance` +
     NavMesh modifiers; lighting probes.
   - **Character:** humanoid avatar check, assigns shared animator controller (idle/walk/talk/inspect/sit), capsule
     and NavMeshAgent → customer/staff/pedestrian template.
   - **Prop / Interior:** colliders, static flags, optional `IInteractable` template (chair, desk, computer, lift, tool chest).
8. **Preview & validate** → opens a preview scene (turntable, scale reference human + car, driving pad for vehicles,
   walk-through for buildings). Validation checklist must pass: scale, colliders, materials, LODs, licence, tri budget.
9. **Approve** → prefab saved to `Library/<Category>/`, registered in `AssetRegistry`; rollback keeps the previous version.

### 7.2 Vehicle Studio
Edit a `CarDefinition`: identity (make/model/trims/years), price & market data, powertrain (engine curve editor,
gearbox ratios, EV battery), physics profile + overrides, component platform, fault tendencies ("this model's
known weak spots"), paint colours, prefab. **Test track** scene button: drive it immediately with telemetry
(speed, rpm, gear, slip per wheel, g-forces), 0–100 timer, braking-distance test.

### 7.3 World Builder
- **Layouts:** a `WorldLayout` asset lists placed sites, roads and props. v4's generated town becomes `Layout_DefaultTown`.
- **Sites:** templates (Small/Large dealership, Auction warehouse, Auction yard, Mechanic garage, Car wash, Fuel
  station, Transport depot, House, Apartment block, Office, Shop). A Site = building prefab + `Site` component with
  function, slots (parking spots, work stations, auction bays, customer spawns, staff spawns), entrance, map icon.
  Swapping the building model keeps the slots.
- **Validation:** each site has an entrance reachable on the NavMesh, a road connection, required slots, a map
  place, and a service zone → otherwise red warnings.
- **Roads:** spline roads (Splines package) with lane count, width, markings, pavements; junction pieces; automatic
  lane graph for traffic; traffic lights/signs placement.
- **Scatter:** trees, lamps, street furniture along splines/areas.
- **Bake:** NavMesh per area, light probes, minimap render, occlusion.

### 7.4 Simulation Configurator
Inspector-style window over all `ConfigAsset`s (economy, market, auction fees, bidder archetypes, personas, staff,
weather, region) with **presets** (Easy/Normal/Hard/Realistic), diff view vs. defaults, and a **sandbox simulator**
(run 30 game-days headless with a scripted player strategy and print P&L — catches broken balance quickly).

---

## 8. Data formulas

All constants below are defaults stored in config assets.

### 8.1 Valuation
```
base        = MarketModel.Price(definition)                      // market value of an average example
ageFactor   = 0.85 ^ (age years) (floored at classic curve for rare models)
mileFactor  = clamp(1 - (mileage - expectedMileage) * 0.000004, 0.55, 1.15)   // expected = 12k/yr
condFactor  = Σ(group weight × groupHealth/100) mapped 0.35..1.05
docFactor   = (V5C ? 1 : 0.75) × (MOT valid ? 1 : 0.90) × serviceHistory(1.06 full / 1.00 partial / 0.95 none) × keys
historyFactor = writeOff (Cat S 0.65, Cat N 0.80, Cat A/B 0) × (mileage anomaly ? 0.80 : 1)
retailValue = base × ageFactor × mileFactor × condFactor × docFactor × historyFactor
tradeValue  = retailValue × 0.78                                  // what dealers pay
```
`CarValueCalculator.MarketValue` returns `retailValue` (v4 callers unchanged).

### 8.2 Repair estimate
`Σ over known faults: parts(tier) + labourHours × rate`; shown as a range when knowledge is an estimate (±25%).

### 8.3 AI auction max bid
```
expectedResale = retail value the bidder *believes* (condition report × archetype optimism)
repairs        = estimated repairs × (1 + riskAppetite × uncertainty)
fees           = buyerPremium(hammer) + transport
maxBid         = (expectedResale × (1 - targetMargin) - repairs - fees) × noise(0.92..1.08)
stop bidding when nextBid > maxBid or budget exhausted
```

### 8.4 Customer car score
```
priceScore   = 1 - clamp((price - budget*0.9) / (budget*0.3), 0, 1)
valueScore   = clamp(retailValue / price, 0.7, 1.3) remapped 0..1    // a good deal vs. market/competitors
score = Σ weight_i × score_i   (price, value, condition-as-perceived, mileage, brand, age, history, economy, docs)
       × categoryPreference × reputationFactor
buy intent if score > persona threshold; walks away if best score < leave threshold
```

### 8.5 Negotiation (extends v4)
Customer target price = `perceivedValue × (1 - haggleSkill × 0.12)`; first offer below target; patience
decreases with each counter and faster for big gaps; trade-in and finance add value terms; insults (offer >25%
above perceived value) cost 2 patience. Salesperson skill raises the customer's ceiling slightly.

### 8.6 Customer footfall per hour
```
base(site level) × reputationFactor(0.5..1.6) × marketing × weather × weekday × hourCurve × (listedCars>0)
```

## 9. Implementation phases

Size: S ≈ 1 session, M ≈ 2–4, L ≈ 5–8, XL ≈ 9+. Each phase ends with: compile check ✅, tests ✅, your Unity
play-test checklist ✅, docs/CHANGELOG updated, commit tagged.

### Phase 0 — Stabilise v4 in the real Unity Editor (S, **needs you**)
1. Create a clean Unity 6 LTS URP project; copy Assets; let the installer add packages; run *Build Everything*.
2. Send me the full Console after import, after Build Everything, and after 10 minutes of play.
3. I fix every compile/runtime error and layout problem you report.
4. I add `Packages/manifest.json` and a minimal project template so the folder opens as a complete project.
5. Play-test checklist v4: walk, drive own car, buy online/used lot/auction, repair, wash, refuel, tow, taxi,
   park on a spot, list, sell to a customer, sleep, buy house, buy dealership, save/load.
6. Push to GitHub once the repo exists.
**Done when:** the checklist passes with no Console errors, and the project is on GitHub.

### Phase 1 — Core, Save v5, tests (M)
1. Create `CarSales.Core`, `CarSales.Sim`, test assemblies; add Newtonsoft + Test Framework to installer.
2. EventBus, ServiceRegistry, GameClock (wrapping DayCycle), SimRandom, ConfigRegistry, RegionProfile (UK).
3. Ledger + `TxCategory`; EconomyManager posts every Spend/Earn to it; DailyReport built from the ledger.
4. Save v5: envelope, modules, atomic write, 3 backups, validation, slots, v4→v5 migration, load menu with slots.
5. EditMode tests: ledger balances, save round-trip, v4 fixture migration, corrupt-file recovery.
**Done when:** all v4 gameplay works unchanged; old v4 save loads; deleting/corrupting `save.json` restores
from backup; ≥ 40 tests green.

#### Phase 1 status
Code complete, compile-checked, **47 EditMode tests passing** (run outside Unity, since the Foundation layer has no
engine dependency). Waiting for the in-Editor play-test below. Changes from the plan above:

| Plan | What was built | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `Assets/CarSales/Core/` + `CarSales.Core` | `Assets/CarSales/Foundation/` + `CarSales.Foundation` (`noEngineReferences: true`) | `Scripts/Core/` already exists; two "Core" folders would be confusing. No engine refs means the tests can run anywhere. |
| Newtonsoft Json | Own small JSON reader for the save envelope (`MiniJson`); module data stays `JsonUtility` | One package fewer to install; the envelope only needs a few fields; module text passes through byte-for-byte. |
| ServiceRegistry, ConfigRegistry, SimRandom, RegionProfile | Deferred | Nothing uses them yet. They arrive with the first system that needs them (Region with documents in Phase 5). |
| `CarSales.Sim` assembly | Deferred to Phase 2 | No simulation logic has moved yet. |
| 3 manual slots + 1 autosave slot | 3 slots, each with 3 rotating backups; nightly autosave goes to the active slot | Simpler to understand; the backups cover the "bad autosave" case. |
| DailyReport built from the ledger | Report keeps its v4 numbers and adds a ledger "In / Out" breakdown | Keeps the v4 report working (rule R1). |

**What Phase 1 added:** `EventBus` + events (`MoneyChanged`, `TransactionPosted`, `DayStarted`, `DayEnded`, `WeekEnded`,
`QuarterEnded`, `GameSaved`, `GameLoaded`) · `Ledger` (21 categories, summaries, reconcile, compaction after 60 days,
lifetime totals) · every money movement in the game tagged with a category · `GameCalendar` (weekday, week, quarter,
year) · Save v5 (`SaveEnvelope`, `SaveStore`, `SaveMigrations`, `SaveValidator`), automatic import of the v4 save
into a slot · main menu **New Game / Load Game** slot picker with delete · Bank page **Account statement** · morning
report money breakdown · weekday on the HUD clock · Test Framework added to the installer.

**Phase 1 play-test checklist (in Unity):**
1. Run *Tools → Car Sales → 2. Build Everything*; Console has no red errors.
2. *Window → General → Test Runner → EditMode → Run All*: 47 tests green.
3. With an old v4 save present: Main Menu → **Continue** loads it (slot 1), your cash and cars are unchanged.
4. Buy, repair, refuel and sell a car; open the computer → **Bank**: each one is a line in the statement.
5. Sleep: the morning report shows the In/Out breakdown; the HUD clock shows the weekday.
6. Main Menu → **New Game** in slot 2, play a day, sleep; **Load Game** shows slots 1 and 2 with day and cash.
7. Quit Play mode, open the save folder (*Tools → Car Sales → Show Save Folder*), corrupt `slot_2/save.json`
   (delete half of it), load slot 2: it loads from a backup with a "Save recovered" message.

### Phase 2 — Vehicle Framework (L)
1. `IVehicleDriver`; ArcadeCarController implements it; TestDriveManager uses only the interface.
2. `WheelVehicleController` + Engine/Gearbox/EV models + ABS/TCS/ESC + physics profiles (10).
3. Placeholder car prefabs get wheel colliders (wizard); settings toggle Arcade/Realistic.
4. Component catalogue (30 components), `ComponentState`, `CarParts` façade, valuation v2 (§8.1).
5. DamageReceiver (zones → panels/components), fuel consumption from load, Cinemachine cameras, engine audio layers.
6. Vehicle Studio (first version) + Test track scene with telemetry.
7. Tests: gearbox shift logic, engine torque lookup, valuation, damage zone mapping, component aggregation.
**Done when:** every placeholder car drives on wheel physics with distinct handling per category (your
judgement), ABS/TCS work, crashes damage specific parts and lower value, Arcade fallback still works.

#### Phase 2 status
**Phase 2a is code complete:** compile-checked, **94 EditMode tests passing** (47 new), waiting for your in-Editor
driving test. Phase 2b (below) is not started.

| Plan | What was built | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Steps 1-2 | `IVehicleDriver`; `WheelVehicleController` (Rigidbody + 4 WheelColliders, anti-roll bars, downforce, speed-sensitive steering); `CarSales.Sim` assembly with `Powertrain` (engine torque curves, automatic gearbox with kick-down and anti-hunting, reverse, electric drive with regen), `DriveInput` (S brakes then reverses), `DriveAssists` (ABS, TCS, ESC), 10 class presets × 4 powertrains | Every preset is checked by `PerformanceEstimator` in the tests: e.g. city hatch 0-100 in 12.0 s, sports car 5.5 s / 290 km/h, about 39 m to stop from 100 km/h. |
| Step 3 | No prefab changes needed: the controller is built at runtime around any model (wheels found by name, or placed from the body size). Settings: Realistic / Arcade, ABS, TCS, ESC | If a model can't be set up, the game falls back to arcade handling and logs why. |
| Step 4 | ~45 components (`ComponentCatalog`) in the 6 v4 groups; `CarParts` is now a façade over them; old saves convert automatically (game save module v6) | Valuation v2 **deferred** until the market model (Phase 7) so prices don't change before they can be play-tested. |
| Step 5 | Crashes hit the side of the car that was hit (front/rear/left/right/roof/underside); fuel use depends on engine load; wear per km for every part; condition changes power, brakes, grip, damping, steering pull and whether the car starts; code-made engine sound | Mesh deformation and recorded engine sounds: Phase 2b / Phase 10. Cinemachine replaced by a small built-in camera (`VehicleCamera`, C cycles chase / far / bonnet) to avoid another package. |
| Step 6 | **Vehicle Studio** window (Tools → Car Sales → Vehicle Studio): every car's class, mass, 0-100, top speed, braking; "Make editable" creates a profile asset in `Assets/CarSales/Data/Physics/` (survives Build Everything) | Test-track scene: Phase 2b. In-game **F3 telemetry** overlay (speed, rpm, gear, slip per wheel, active assists, condition effects). |
| Step 7 | Tests for torque curve, shifting, anti-hunting, reverse, EV, assists, steering limit, fuel, class performance, component weights, conversion, damage zones, wear, driving effects | |

**Phase 2b: code complete** (104 EditMode tests passing, compile-checked, waiting for the in-Editor test):

| Item | What was built |
|---|---|
| Test-track scene | `Generated/Scenes/TestTrack.unity` (built by Build Everything; *Tools → Car Sales → 5. Open Test Track*): 940 m straight with distance boards, braking zone, slalom lane, bump lane, skid-pad circle, ramp, knock-over cones. `TestTrackController` runs without the economy/UI and measures 0-100, braking distance from 95+ km/h, top speed and cornering g next to the simulated figures. N/B car, 1-4 condition, G realistic/arcade, M manual/auto, R reset. Vehicle Studio has a **Drive** button per car. |
| Manual gearbox | Settings → Gearbox: MANUAL. Left Shift / Left Ctrl (gamepad bumpers) shift up / down; Ctrl in 1st at a standstill = R. Automatic clutch; over-revving downshifts are refused. New input actions `GearUp`, `GearDown`. |
| Mesh deformation | `DentModel` (Sim, tested) turns body-panel health into dents per zone; `CarDamageVisual` applies them to copies of the meshes on parked, listed and driven cars, and removes them after repair. No extra save data. Imported models need *Read/Write* enabled on the mesh (Asset Studio will do this in Phase 3). |
| Component detail view | Inspection → **All parts**: every component per group with bars, plus how the condition affects driving (power, brakes, grip, shocks, won't start). |
| Tuning pass | **Waiting for your driving feedback** - the presets are tuned to real-world numbers but the feel can only be judged in the Editor. |

**Phase 2b play-test checklist:**
1. Build Everything; open *5. Open Test Track*; Play. The panel at the top right shows the car and measurements.
2. Full throttle from the start line: the 0-100 time appears; compare with "Simulated".
3. At 100+ km/h brake fully (hold S): the braking distance appears (about 35-45 m with good brakes); try 4 (25% condition).
4. Slalom and skid pad: watch "Cornering g" (about 0.8-1.0 g is realistic for road tyres).
5. Press M for manual, drive with Left Shift / Left Ctrl.
6. Hit a cone barrier / the ramp edge hard: dents appear at that end of the car; N/B to switch cars.
7. In the town: inspect a damaged car → All parts; repair the body at the workshop → the dents disappear.

**Phase 2 play-test checklist (in Unity):**
1. Build Everything, Play. Get into your own car (F): it drives on wheels, the HUD shows the gear next to KM/H.
2. Accelerate hard on the main road: it shifts up through the gears; lift off: it slows down (engine braking).
3. Hold S while moving: it brakes; keep holding when stopped: it reverses ("R"). Space: handbrake slide.
4. Press C: chase / far chase / bonnet camera. Press F3: telemetry.
5. Drive the sports car and the pickup: they should feel clearly different (power, weight, body roll).
6. Crash into a wall nose-first: "Front damaged"; the inspection report lists the damaged front parts.
7. Settings → Physics: ARCADE, get in again: the old handling still works.
8. Park on a dealership spot (E), refuel (E at the pumps), get out (F): all as before.
9. Tell me how it feels: too slippery, too grippy, rolls too much, too fast or too slow?
### Phase 3 — Asset Studio (L, needs you to supply assets)
1. Studio window shell, `AssetRecord`, `LicenceRecord`, `AssetRegistry`, credits generator, release-build licence validator.
2. Local/Drop-folder ingest, Analyse, Normalise, Materials (URP Lit), Colliders, LODs.
3. Vehicle integration (wheel/door detection + manual correction) → drivable prefab + CarDefinition.
4. Building, Character, Prop/Interior templates.
5. Sketchfab connector (search + download with your token), Poly Haven connector (HDRI/textures).
6. Preview scene + validation checklist + approve/rollback.
**Done when (audit acceptance):** you import at least 1 vehicle, 1 building, 1 character and 1 prop from external
sources; the vehicle drives, the building works as a site, the character walks as a customer, all with licence records.

#### Phase 3 status
**Phase 3a: code complete** (157 EditMode tests passing, compile-checked, waiting for you to import real models):

| Step | Built |
|---|---|
| 1 | *Tools → Car Sales → Asset Studio* (Import / Library / Licences tabs). `AssetRegistry` (`Library/Resources/CarSalesAssetRegistry.asset`) with an `AssetRecord` + `LicenceInfo` per asset; `LicencePolicy` (CC0/CC BY/BY-SA/NC/ND, Asset Store, purchased, editorial, unknown); credits generator; release builds fail on blocked licences, development builds warn; `CREDITS.txt` written next to every build. |
| 2 | Import from a file picker, drag & drop (files or project models), the Drop folder (`Art/_Drop`), or any model already in the project (Asset Store). Copies the model plus textures/.bin/.mtl into `Art/<Category>/<Name>/Source`, sets import options (Read/Write for cars, no animation for props, no cameras/lights). Analysis: triangles, meshes, materials, skinned meshes, size. Scale & orientation guess (unit mix-ups cm/mm/inch, Z-up exports, length along X), editable. "Fix materials for URP": extracts embedded materials, converts Built-in Standard/legacy shaders to URP Lit, fills missing textures from file names (`_BaseColor`, `_Normal`, `_AO`...). Colliders per category. |
| 3 | Wheel detection by name + position (`WheelDetection`, shared with the runtime), manual correction with 4 dropdowns; paint-material picker (multi-slot paint in `CarVisual`); car data (fictional brand, category, year, price, fuel). Approve → prefab with `VehicleRig` + `CarVisual`, `CarDefinition` in `Data/Cars` added to the car list (kept by Build Everything) → drive it on the test track. |
| 4 | Basic templates: Building/Environment (mesh colliders, static), Prop/Interior (box collider), Character (capsule + Animator). |
| 6 | Validation checklist (budgets from §11, size range, wheels, paint, licence) blocks Approve on errors; interactive previews of the source and the result; versioned prefabs with **Roll back** (same GUID, so references survive) and **Remove**. |

**Phase 3b: code complete** (187 EditMode tests passing, compile-checked; not run in Unity):

| Item | Built |
|---|---|
| Sketchfab | Asset Studio → **Online** tab: search (downloadable models, optional "cars & vehicles" category) with thumbnails, author and licence verdict; *Download & set up* with your API token (stored in EditorPrefs on your computer, never in the project). GLB preferred, glTF zip as fallback; the licence record is filled in from Sketchfab. GLB/glTF needs the glTFast package (button in the Import tab). |
| Poly Haven | Online tab: CC0 skies (HDRI → Skybox/Panoramic material, *Use as sky* in the Library) and materials (maps → URP Lit, roughness packed into metallic-smoothness, normal maps flagged). "Powered by Poly Haven" credit and an app User-Agent, as their API terms ask. |
| Characters | Humanoid check and *Make humanoid*; idle/walk clips found by name in the model and next to it (Mixamo), looped, Animator Controller with a `Speed` parameter. *Use as a customer*: customers spawn with a random imported character instead of the capsule (`AssetRegistry.RandomCustomerModel`, `CustomerAI.UseAppearance`). |
| Buildings | `BuildingInfo` (function: dealership, workshop, car wash, ... and an Entrance marker). They become working sites with the World Builder (Phase 8). |
| LODs | Models that ship with `_LOD0/_LOD1...` meshes get a LODGroup; on Unity versions with import-time mesh LOD generation it is switched on for props, buildings and environment (by reflection, ignored where it doesn't exist). |
| Preview scene | *Preview in scene*: a new unsaved scene with the asset, a ground grid and a 1.80 m person for scale. |

**Not verified here:** this environment can't reach sketchfab.com or api.polyhaven.com. Poly Haven's formats were
checked against its published API spec; Sketchfab's licence and download formats are handled in both documented
shapes, but the first real download is the test. Report any "Unexpected answer" message.

**Still open for the Phase 3 acceptance:** importing your real 1 car, 1 building, 1 character and 1 prop.

**Phase 3 play-test checklist:**
1. Download a free CC0 or CC BY car (e.g. from Sketchfab as FBX or GLB) and note the author/licence.
2. *Asset Studio → Import model file...*; category Vehicle; fill in the licence.
3. Check *Final size* (~4-5 m long) and the turn: the car's front must face +Z (try 180° if it drives backwards).
4. Check the 4 wheels and tick the paint material(s); fill in the car data.
5. *Fix materials for URP* if it looks pink; *Approve*; *Drive on test track*.
6. Back in the town, the car appears for sale (marketplace / used lot) and can be painted, bought, driven and dented.
7. *Licences* tab → *Write CREDITS.txt*.
8. Online tab: paste your Sketchfab API token, search "car", *Download & set up* a CC BY model.
9. Online → Poly Haven: download a sky and *Use as sky* (Library tab); download an asphalt material.
10. Import a character (e.g. from Mixamo with idle + walk), *Make humanoid*, *Find idle/walk*, Approve with
    *Use as a customer*; in the town, customers now look like it and walk.
### Phase 4 — UI design system & visual pass (L)
1. `UITheme` + component library; screen stack, transitions, focus navigation, UI scale.
2. Redesign HUD, main menu (save slots), dealer computer desktop, vehicle file, marketplace, map.
3. Phone OS with apps (existing tow/taxi/map move in).
4. Lighting pass: URP settings, post-processing profile, HDRI sky, reflection probes, day/night tuning.
5. Replace placeholder cars/characters/buildings with imported assets you choose (via Asset Studio).
**Done when:** every existing screen uses the theme; no hard-coded colours remain (lint test); phone replaces the old phone.

#### Phase 4 status
**Phase 4a: code complete** (189 EditMode tests incl. the colour lint, compile-checked with URP; not run in Unity):

| Item | Built |
|---|---|
| Theme | `UITheme` / `UIPalette` (~40 colour tokens + open-animation time); presets **Dark** (original), **Light**, **High contrast**, and **Custom** (`Create > CarSales > UI Theme`, saved as `Resources/CarSalesUITheme`). `UIFactory` colours read the theme; every hard-coded colour in the screens replaced by tokens; button text picks dark/light automatically for contrast. |
| Lint | `UiLintTests`: no literal colours in `Scripts/UI` except the theme itself (and two constants in UIFactory). |
| Motion & navigation | Windows fade/scale in (`UITransition`, real time so it works while paused); with a gamepad the first button gets focus. |
| UI scale | Settings → Interface size 80-130%, applied immediately (game and main menu). |
| Phone | New phone: status bar (time, cash, energy), home screen with clock, date, notifications and 9 apps. Tow, Taxi, Bank (balance, loan, today, recent transactions) and Messages run on the phone; Map, My cars, Market, Real estate, Settings open their screens. `ShowTow(car)` kept. |
| Lighting | Build Everything adds URP post-processing to the game, menu and test-track cameras (ACES tonemapping, bloom, colour adjustments, vignette, SMAA; profile `Generated/Settings/PostProcessing.asset`) and uses the newest Poly Haven sky from the Asset Studio. `DayNightLighting` dims the sky at night (on a runtime copy of the material) and refreshes ambient light/reflections from it. |

**Phase 4b: code complete** (193 EditMode tests, compile-checked with URP; not run in Unity):

| Item | Built |
|---|---|
| Components | `UIComponents.cs` (partial `UIFactory`): `Tabs` (tabs / segmented), sortable `MakeTable` (click a header; capped at 250 rows), `Modal` / `Confirm` dialogs (Esc closes), `StatTile`, `Chart` (bar chart, negatives below the axis), `Badge`, `EmptyState`, `SectionTitle`. |
| Screen stack | `UIManager.Back()` (Esc / gamepad B): a screen can handle it (`IBackHandler`: phone → home screen, computer app → desktop), else it returns to the screen it came from (e.g. vehicle file → marketplace), else closes. `Close()` still closes everything. |
| HUD | Minimal: clock + shop status dot + thin energy bar (top-left), cash with +/- change and reputation/loan (top-right), slim GPS strip, smaller minimap, speed/gear/fuel cluster **only while driving**, prompts with a key cap (`[E] ...`), controls list on **H** (shown for the first 25 s). Fades out while a menu is open. |
| Dealer computer | Desktop with 16 app icons (Dashboard, My Cars, Marketplace, Auctions, Messages + unread badge, Bank, **Accounts**, Real Estate, Upgrades, Statistics, Settings; Workshop/Customers/Staff/Marketing/Competitors marked *Soon*), widgets (clock, today, goal, messages) and a taskbar (cash, clock, log off). Apps open in a window; `ui.inventory.Show()` etc. unchanged. |
| Accounts app | Today / 7 / 30 days / all kept: income, expenses, profit, cash tiles; profit-per-day chart (14 days); totals by category; sortable transaction table. New `Ledger.DailyNet`, `ForRef`, `NetForRef`. |
| Vehicle file | `VehicleDetailsUI` with tabs **Overview, Condition** (per area, after inspection), **Documents** (placeholder until phase 5), **History** (ledger entries for the car), **Costs** (buy-in maths for listings; break-even and profit for your cars), **Listing**. Opens for listings, cars at the Used Car Market and your own cars (`ShowOwned`; *File* in My Cars, *Vehicle file* in the car menu). Deal badge via `PriceRating`. |
| Marketplace | Filter sidebar (search, body type, max price, min condition, verified only, good deals only, reset), sort incl. *Best deal*, grid or list (sortable table) view; cards show *Great deal / Good price / Overpriced* and *Verified* badges. |
| Map | Full screen; filters by kind (dealers, services, markets, homes, property) with counts; zoom x1-x4 and *Me*; click an icon to set the GPS; route drawn along the NavMesh with its length. Map size adapts to the interface size. |
| Main menu | `MenuCinematic` camera: four slow dolly shots blended together, the car framed right of the menu; two more cars on the stage. Save slots show a **thumbnail** (`thumb.png` in the slot folder, written on every save). |
| Reflections | Box-projected realtime reflection probes (rendered once on start) in every showroom and on the menu stage. |
| Placeholders → your models | Backdrop buildings, trees, street lamps and benches are now `PlaceholderSlot` groups. **Asset Studio → Town**: tick approved Building / Prop models per kind (several = variety), *Apply to the town scene* (fits size, stands it on the ground, faces the street, re-bakes the NavMesh). Choices live in `Data/PlaceholderReplacements.asset`; Build Everything re-applies them. Shops/showrooms/homes stay (they carry interactions). |
| Lint | Also rejects hex colours in rich text (`<color=#...>`); the 7 that existed now use tokens. |

**Phase 4b play-test checklist:**
1. Build Everything, Play from the main menu: the camera moves between shots; slots show a picture after your first save.
2. HUD: walking shows no speedometer; get in a car: speed, gear, fuel appear. H toggles the controls. Earn money: +$ pops under the cash.
3. Dealer computer: desktop, open apps, Esc goes back to the desktop, then closes. Accounts: switch periods, sort the transactions.
4. Marketplace: filters, *Best deal*, List view; open a car: tabs; Esc returns to the marketplace. My Cars → *File* → Costs.
5. M: filters, zoom, click a place: dotted route along the roads.
6. Import one building and one tree (Prop) in the Asset Studio, tick them in **Town**, *Apply*, Play: they stand in the town.
7. A showroom at noon: the floor and car paint reflect the room.

**Phase 4a play-test checklist:**
1. Build Everything (adds post-processing; uses your Poly Haven sky if you imported one), Play.
2. Settings: change *Interface size* (instant) and *Theme* (Light / High contrast; reload the game to see it).
3. Open any windows: they fade in; with a gamepad, a button is selected.
4. P: the new phone - check the clock, notifications, Bank, Tow (move a car), Taxi, and the other apps.
5. Watch a sunset and a night: the sky gets darker, lamps glow (bloom).
6. Test Runner: `UiLintTests` green.
### Phase 5 — Inspection, workshop, documents (L)
1. PlayerKnowledge + inspection methods + Inspection Mode (sockets, checklist).
2. Fault catalogue (40), progression, DTC scanner upgrade.
3. Parts catalogue, suppliers, parts inventory, repair jobs, workstations, Workshop Board, DIY repair interaction.
4. Documents & history (V5C, MOT + MOT bay, service book, keys, history check, write-off categories), VIN/plates.
5. Vehicle file tabs: Condition, Documents, History, Costs.
**Done when:** a car bought "blind" can be inspected step by step, revealing faults per method; repairs consume
parts + time + money and change value; an MOT can pass/fail with advisories; a history check can expose a Cat N.

#### Phase 5 status
**Phase 5a: code complete** (214 EditMode tests, compile-checked; not run in Unity). All four "done when" points are covered:

| Item | Built |
|---|---|
| Faults | `Sim/Faults/FaultCatalog.cs`: 40 faults on real components, each with symptom, OBD code, which methods find it, MOT effect, value impact and daily progression. Generated from component wear (worn parts get far more faults); a fault caps its component's health; faults get worse every night (known ones warn you when they turn severe). |
| Knowledge & inspection | `Sim/Inspection/Inspection.cs`: walk-around, interior, under the bonnet, OBD scanner (buy one, $300), road test (drive 1 km; mild faults rarely noticed), lift ($40, your cars), history check ($15), full garage inspection ($120, also for online listings). Skill (grows with practice) raises the chance to notice. Only found faults are shown or priced by a buyer who hasn't checked. Interior check can spot clocking. |
| Documents & history | `Sim/Documents/VehicleRecords.cs`: VIN with check digit, UK plate with age identifier, logbook (missing 8%: -25%), keepers, keys (0 keys: can't drive), MOT expiry + history, service history (+6% full, -5% none), write-offs Cat N (-20%) / Cat S (-35%), outstanding finance (the lender may repossess the car: 4%/day until settled), clocked mileage (MOT records show it). |
| MOT | `MotTest`: tyre tread (1.6 mm), pads, discs, lights, shocks, bushes, steering, emissions, glass and MOT-relevant faults → pass/fail + advisories; revealed faults become known; a pass gives 365 days. |
| Workshop | `Sim/Workshop/Workshop.cs`: 35 parts in Used / Aftermarket / OEM (used 50-80% health, aftermarket ~88%, OEM 100%), 3 suppliers (motor factor today, online -15% next morning, breaker's yard used parts with daily stock), 35 repair jobs covering every component, price scaled by car class. `WorkshopManager`: storage, orders, garage jobs ($65/h, progress with the clock), do-it-yourself (time passes, small botch risk), MOT, logbook ($25, 5 days), locksmith ($150), finance settlement. Saved as module `workshop` v1. |
| Value | `CarValueCalculator.MarketValue` × faults × paperwork × history (`CarRecords.ValueMultiplier`); marketplace prices use only what the seller shows, so hidden problems are your loss. |
| UI | Inspection checklist + findings (symptom, code, MOT, repair estimate); Workshop app on the desktop (Repairs, Parts, Jobs, MOT & paperwork); vehicle file **Documents** (plate, VIN, logbook, MOT, service, keys, MOT history) and **History** (history check, your records) tabs, faults in **Condition**; marketplace badges *No logbook* / *MOT expired*; road-test findings as toasts. |

**Phase 5b: code complete** (221 EditMode tests, compile-checked; not run in Unity):

| Item | Built |
|---|---|
| Service centre | Build Everything adds the **AUTO WORLD Service Centre** east of the main dealership (driveway from the road): **mechanical bay** with a lift, **tyre bay** (tyre changer, balancer), **MOT bay** (brake rollers, headlamp tester), parts shelves, workbench, reflection probe, map place. Each bay has a console (`WorkStation`: bay box, finds the car you parked in it). |
| Hands-on mode | `HandsOnSession`: glowing markers on the car; look at one and **hold E**. Inspection: 4 wheels (walk-around), bonnet, driver's door (interior), OBD port (with scanner), underneath (only on your lift, free). Repairs: undo 2-4 bolts, swap the part, tighten them, in order; 20% quicker than the garage and half the botch risk. Walk 12 m away to stop (parts go back on the shelf). |
| Workshop Board | Workshop app → **Board** (also from the board on the service-centre wall): Waiting for parts → Ready → In progress → Done today; order parts, send to the town garage, or do it by hand from a card. *Add to board* from Repairs. |
| Mechanic | Hire one ($140/day, paid each morning; leaves if you can't pay): works 08:00-18:00 through the Ready column at your service centre, no labour bills, small botch chance. Ledger category *Wages*. |
| Parts Direct | Parts counter in town: 10% cheaper than the motor factor, same day (`Supplier.Counter`, only while you're at the counter). |
| MOT bay | Test your own cars for free (45 min); the town garage test stays in the app ($55). |
| World dialogs | Dialogs opened from the world (bay consoles) now behave like menus (cursor free, player stops). |

**Phase 5b play-test checklist:**
1. Build Everything, Play. Find the service centre east of AUTO WORLD (map: S) and Parts Direct in town (P).
2. Drive a car into the mechanical bay, use the console → *Inspect by hand*: hold E on each marker, including underneath.
3. Workshop app → Repairs: *Add to board*; go to Parts Direct, order with the counter price; Board: card moves to Ready.
4. Card → *By hand* with the car in the bay: undo the bolts, fit, tighten. Check the condition went up.
5. Hire the mechanic, put two jobs on the board, wait (or sleep): they're done; wages show in Accounts.
6. MOT bay: run a free MOT on an old car.

**Phase 5a play-test checklist:**
1. New game (or load: older cars get records the first time they're seen).
2. Used Car Market: open a car → Inspect: walk-around, interior, under the bonnet; see findings appear. History check: look for Cat N.
3. Online listing: only the history check and full inspection are possible.
4. Buy a car, drive it 1 km: a road-test toast. Computer → Workshop: buy the scanner, order parts, garage vs. do it yourself; wait for the job.
5. Workshop → MOT & paperwork: run an MOT on an old car (fail with tyres/pads?), fix, re-test.
6. Vehicle file → Documents / History / Costs: the repair costs add up, the value changes.

### Phase 6 — Auction ecosystem (L)
1. AuctionEngine (venues, events, lots, reports, buyer accounts, invoices, fees, storage, collection).
2. AI bidder archetypes with §8.3 maths.
3. Physical yard + hall built as World Builder sites (numbered bays, auctioneer, paddle bidding).
4. Online terminal (calendar, catalogue, proxy bids, soft close), outbid notifications on phone.
5. Salvage/fleet/repossession event types; risks.
**Done when (audit acceptance):** you can register, inspect lots, bid live in the hall and online, win, pay the
invoice (fees + VAT in the ledger), and collect the car (drive/tow), and lose lots to AI bidders who bid sensibly.

#### Phase 6 status
**Code complete** (232 EditMode tests, compile-checked; not run in Unity). Every acceptance point has a path:

| Item | Built |
|---|---|
| Engine | `Sim/Auction/AuctionEngine.cs`: venues (Auction Center hall, TradeNet online, SalvageBid online), events, lots, condition reports (grade 1-5, listed faults/damage, keys, starts, V5C, mileage verified; reliability 85% / 75% / 50%), buyer accounts, invoices, increments ($50/100/250/500), buyer's premium table, $20 internet fee, VAT 20% on fees, 2-day payment, $50/day late, cancel after 5 days (deposit kept), 3 free storage days then $15/day, reserves and provisional bids, proxy bidding, soft close (+2 min). |
| AI bidders | 16 persistent bidders, 7 archetypes (private, small trader, franchise grade 4+, exporter likes Japanese/4x4, breaker salvage floor, mechanic, dealer group) with the §8.3 formula from the report (never the truth), budgets and lots-per-day limits. |
| Calendar | Dealer sales Tue/Thu/Sat 11:00, fleet Wed 13:00, repossessions Fri 14:00 (hall); TradeNet every day and SalvageBid Mon/Thu (lots close 14:00-20:00). Published 7 days ahead, catalogues 2 days before. |
| Sale types & risks | Fleet: good, full service, 2 keys. Salvage: body damage, Cat N/S, missing keys, "non-runners" that only need a battery, no title guarantee. Repossession: one key, missing logbooks, finance cleared by the hall. Reports can miss faults; salvage reports may over-state keys. |
| Hall | Walk-in hall: seats, stage (lot car on it), rostrum with auctioneer, big screen. Inside during a sale: overlay with lot, bid, leader, *going once / twice / sold* (4 s each, reset by bids); **E raises your paddle**. Not there: lots go every 6 game minutes with your absentee max. |
| Yard | 12 numbered bays: today's and tomorrow's hall lots for viewing; E on a car → lot (report, history check, inspect - no road test, max bid, watch). |
| Online terminal | Auctions app (desk, computer desktop, phone): Calendar, Catalogue (lot list + detail), My bids (sortable), Invoices (pay; GPS to the car park), Accounts (register $500 deposit / close and refund). Online lots: max bid, live current price, outbid toast + message, soft close. |
| Money | Paying posts VehiclePurchase (hammer), Auction (fees), VAT, Fines (late); deposits in *Deposits*; storage in Auction. Car appears in the Auction Center car park; collected once it leaves (drive or tow). |
| Save | Module `auction` v1 (events, lots, lot cars, invoices, accounts, bidders). |

**Phase 6 play-test checklist:**
1. Build Everything, Play. Auctions app → Calendar; Accounts: register at the Auction Center and TradeNet.
2. Day before a hall sale: walk the yard, open a lot, inspect it (walk-around, bonnet...), set a max bid on another.
3. Sale day: be in the hall at the start: watch the calls, press E to bid, win a lot; lose one to an AI bidder.
4. Online: set a max on a TradeNet lot; get outbid (toast), raise it; win at close.
5. Pay the invoices (Accounts app shows fees + VAT); drive or tow the car out of the car park; skip paying one to see late fees.
6. Salvage: find a "non-runner", scan it (battery), win it cheaply.

### Phase 7 — Dealership operations: sourcing, customers, staff (XL)
1. MarketModel (price index, seasons, supply/demand) + competitors (off-screen) + competitor research page.
2. Private sellers (ads, appointments at houses, seller NPCs), dealer trade offers, trade-ins.
3. Listing editor (multi-angle photos, description, price helper) → online leads.
4. BuyerPersonas + BuyerBrain + inspection animations + Q&A + customer test drives + negotiation 2.0 + paperwork/handover + reviews.
5. CRM, follow-ups, repeat customers, warranties/complaints.
6. Staff: hiring, skills, wages, job board, salespeople/mechanics/detailers/drivers.
**Done when:** a full cycle works without debug tools: source → inspect → transport → repair/MOT/detail →
photograph & list → customer inspects + test drives → negotiate (trade-in/finance) → paperwork → handover → review;
a mechanic and a salesperson can each do their part of this without the player.

#### Phase 7 status
**Phase 7a: code complete** (243 EditMode tests, compile-checked; not run in Unity):

| Item | Built |
|---|---|
| Market | `Sim/Market/MarketModel.cs` + `MarketManager`: price index per model and body type (mean-reverting ±0.5%/day, 0.8-1.25), seasons (sports +8% summer, SUV/pickup +5% winter), demand dips 2% per sale and recovers, supply from your own listings (±5%). Applied in `CarValueCalculator.MarketValue`. Save module `market`. |
| Competitors | Downtown Motors (+10%), Luxury Lane (+18%, better cars), Cheap Wheels (+2%, rough cars): daily stock; Market app compares each of your listed cars with the cheapest rival. |
| Dealer trade | A wholesale batch of 3-6 cars every Monday (15-30% under market, take it all), bought to free spots. |
| Buyers | 9 buyer types (§6.10) with budgets, body-type tastes, weights, knowledge, haggling, patience, finance and trade-in chances, review harshness. Customers score every listed car (§8.4) and pick among the best. Happy past customers come back. |
| Negotiation 2.0 | Opening offer and hidden limit from the buyer type and how much they like the car; knowledgeable buyers notice faults you didn't mention (limit drops, patience drops); **Disclose faults** (they price them in, review you better, no complaint); **trade-in** (their car onto your lot at their asking credit; they're 3% keener); **finance** (lender approval from credit score and deposit; 3% commission, ledger *Finance commission*; declined = budget only). |
| Reviews & CRM | Every sale: 1-5 stars (condition, price vs value, honesty, haggling, harshness) → reputation. Hiding known faults → a complaint 2-6 days later (-2 rep each). Customers app: records (type, visits, purchases, spent, satisfaction) and reviews. Save module `crm`. |
| Staff | `Sim/Staff/Staff.cs` + `StaffManager`: weekly candidates (3-6), skills 25-90, wages by role and skill (ledger *Wages*, weekly), morale from pay, sick days, experience raises skill. **Salesperson**: takes customers who wait 10 s, discloses known faults, closes above your minimum margin. **Mechanic**: works the workshop board (speed by skill; replaces the phase 5b mechanic). **Detailer**: cleans the dirtiest cars on your lots. **Driver**: brings paid auction cars to your dealership. Staff app (Team, Recruitment, Rules). Save module `staff`. |

**Phase 7b: code complete** (249 EditMode tests, compile-checked; not run in Unity):

| Item | Built |
|---|---|
| Private sellers | `Sim/Customers/Sourcing.cs` + `SourcingManager`: 2-3 classified ads a day (10-25% under market, honesty 0-1, hidden floor), Market app → *Classifieds* (desktop tile). Book a viewing (next hour, 09:00-19:00); the seller waits two hours with the car on a driveway at **Maple Close** (6 houses, built by the wizard; falls back to near the Used Car Market). Talk to them (E): five questions (honest or lying answers), inspect (all on-the-lot methods), *around the block* (road test at 60% skill), history check, haggle (found faults lower their floor), pay; logbook and keys handed over (or not). Save module `sourcing`. |
| Listing editor | Car menu → *Sell / listing* (also the vehicle file): up to 6 photos from different angles (`ThumbnailService.Get(car, angle)`), highlights that must be true (FSH, long MOT, low mileage, one owner, valeted 90%+, warranty, known faults listed), price slider with market value, cheapest rival and the usual range, *advertise online*. Quality 0-1 → enquiries per day. |
| Leads | Online adverts bring enquiries each morning (message: who and when); that customer comes to view that car with a head start on interest. |
| Customers | Walk round the car before deciding (tyres, inside, bonnet). In negotiation they ask 1-3 questions (problems, service history, MOT, mileage, accidents): answer honestly or dodge - a dodge about bad news counts as hiding it (review/complaint later). **Test drive**: alone or riding along (needs a valid MOT, key, fuel); road-test faults may be noticed; a clean drive raises their interest. |
| Paperwork & handover | After the price: invoice, logbook transfer, service records, keys, MOT - completeness changes the review (-0.75 to +0.5 stars). Offer a **3-month warranty** (4% of the price, $150-$900; buyers decide by type): income in *Warranties*, claims later cost the repair of the car's real faults. |
| Staff | **Receptionist**: 30% more enquiries, customers arrive 20% more often. **Manager**: +10% morale and +10% work speed for everyone. |

**Phase 7b play-test checklist:**
1. Build Everything (adds Maple Close). Computer → *Classifieds*: book a viewing, GPS there, talk to the seller, ask "any problems?", inspect, drive round the block, haggle, buy.
2. Car menu → *Sell / listing*: take 6 photos, tick highlights, set the price, advertise online. Next morning: an enquiry message; the customer comes for that car.
3. Talk to a customer: answer their questions, let them test drive (ride along), agree a price, then do the handover and offer a warranty.
4. Hire a receptionist and a manager; watch more customers arrive.

**Phase 7a play-test checklist:**
1. List a few cars, open the shop. Talk to customers: the prompt shows their type (e.g. savvy haggler).
2. Negotiate with a customer who brings a trade-in and wants finance: try *Disclose*, trade-in on/off, finance.
3. After the sale: Customers app → Reviews. Sell a car with known faults without disclosing: a complaint arrives later.
4. Staff app: hire a salesperson and a mechanic; ignore a customer for 10 s - the salesperson sells; plan a board job - the mechanic does it.
5. Market app: price trend, body-type factors, competitor comparison; buy a Monday trade batch.
6. Week end: wages in Accounts.

### Phase 8 — World Builder, open world, world simulation (XL)
1. World Builder layouts/sites/validation; convert the v4 town to `Layout_DefaultTown`.
2. Spline roads + junctions + lane graph; traffic cars + lights; pedestrians.
3. Weather + wet roads + effects on footfall/grip; calendar & bank holidays; fuel prices; random events.
4. Building interiors for dealership/auction hall/workshop (from imported assets).
**Done when:** you can build a new dealership site from an imported building and it works (spots, customers,
computer); traffic and pedestrians run at the performance budget.

#### Phase 8 status
**Phase 8a: code complete** (257 EditMode tests, compile-checked; not run in Unity, so frame times are not measured yet):

| Item | Built |
|---|---|
| Weather | `Sim/World/WorldSim.cs` + `WorldManager`: hourly Markov weather (clear, cloudy, overcast, rain, heavy rain, fog; wetter in winter, fog clears by late morning). Rain particles around the camera, fog, dimmer sun, shiny wet roads (runtime copy of the asphalt material), **grip 85% / 75%** in rain / heavy rain (wheel friction), **footfall -30% / -45%**, lot cars get dirty in the rain. HUD shows the weather. |
| Calendar | Sunday trading (open an hour later, close two earlier; `DayCycleManager.OpenHour/CloseHour`), bank holidays (+40% customers), Saturdays +30%, Sundays -20%. |
| Fuel | Daily fuel price index (±2%, 0.75-1.4) → refuelling cost, and dear fuel makes economical cars worth more (`EconomyDemand`). |
| Events | Police checks while driving (no MOT = $100 fine), breakdowns of stock with severe faults (off sale), road works (-20% customers for two days), theft attempts (staff may stop them), and an **open day** you book from the Customers app ($600, +60% customers). Save module `world`. |
| Traffic | `Sim/World/RoadGraph.cs`: lane graph from road segments (two lanes each, **driving on the left**, junctions where 3+ road ends meet, no U-turns); `TrafficSystem` + `TrafficCar`: kinematic cars from the car database, gap keeping, stop at red lights (`TrafficLight` poles at every junction, two-phase 30 s cycle) and for anything with a rigidbody in front (you), stop with "hazards" after a bump, random turns, spawn out of sight 70-220 m away, despawn at 260 m, density by hour, **max 14 cars** (budget 30). |
| Pedestrians | `PedestrianSystem`: up to **18 walkers** (budget 40) on the pavements, your imported characters if any, fewer at night and in rain; passers-by at an open dealership sometimes walk in as customers. |
| World Builder | **Tools > Car Sales > World Builder**: *Sites* - add a dealership (name, standard or premium, standard glass showroom **or an imported Building from the Asset Studio** fitted into the footprint, price (0 = owned) and rent, position/turn, "use the Scene view's centre") → built into the town with 14 spots, computer, customers, sign, map icon, NavMesh baked; kept in `Data/WorldLayout.asset` and rebuilt by Build Everything; rebuild/remove. A bought-later site registers itself as a property (Real Estate). *Validate* - every `Site` in the scene: entrance on the NavMesh, a road within 45 m, map place, dealership spots/spawns/exit/NavMesh/computer. Generated town → `Data/Layout_DefaultTown.asset`; `RoadNetwork` holds the town's road segments. |

**Phase 8b: code complete** (259 EditMode tests, compile-checked; not run in Unity):

| Item | Built |
|---|---|
| Roads | World Builder → **Roads**: *Draw a road* - click start and end in the Scene view (cyan ring = snapped point; ends snap to road ends or onto a road within 8 m, `RoadEditing.Snap`). A road ending on another splits it so a junction (and traffic lights) appear (`RoadEditing.Add/SplitAt`). *Apply roads to the town*: asphalt, pavements, centre dashes, trees every 24 m and street lamps every 40 m on both sides (optional per road; they're placeholder slots, so the Asset Studio *Town* tab swaps them too), and the `RoadNetwork` (default roads + yours) that traffic follows. Kept in `Data/WorldLayout.asset` (`userRoads`) and rebuilt by Build Everything. Straight pieces: chain several for a bend. |
| Site types | Dealership, Premium dealership, **Workshop**, **Car wash**, **Fuel station**, **Parts shop**, **House** (buy it, live there: wake 07:00, +0.3 rep/day), **Apartments** (buy, earns your set income nightly), **Building** (scenery: an imported building). Houses and apartments with a price register as properties (Real Estate). |
| Interiors | Dealerships can have an imported **Interior** asset fitted inside the showroom (21×11 m, no extra colliders). |
| Performance | Settings → *Traffic & people* (off / low / normal / busy) and *Frame-rate overlay* (fps, frame time, worst frame, counts, density). `PerformanceGovernor`: under 45 fps for 5 s → 15% fewer cars and people (down to 30%); over 58 fps for 10 s → back up. Traffic more than 120 m away ticks at 4 Hz (spec §11). Measuring against the §11 budgets needs a run on the target PC - use the overlay. |

**Phase 8b play-test checklist:**
1. World Builder → Roads (town scene open): draw a road from the south road at (0, -27) down to (0, -120), and a second one across it; Apply. Play: traffic turns into it, lights at the new junction.
2. Sites: add a Workshop and a House next to the new road, and a dealership with an imported building + interior; Validate.
3. Settings → Frame-rate overlay ON; Traffic BUSY in the rain at AUTO WORLD: note the fps and whether the density drops.

**Phase 8a play-test checklist:**
1. Build Everything, Play. Watch traffic stop at the lights at x = ±70; stand in the road - cars stop for you.
2. Wait for rain (or check the HUD): rain, wet roads, fewer customers; drive - the car slides more.
3. Sunday: later opening. Customers app: book an open day; next day is busy.
4. World Builder → Sites: add "Riverside Motors" at (-200, 0, 30) facing south, with an imported building; Play: buy it in Real Estate, list a car there, customers come.
5. World Builder → Validate with the town open: all sites green (warnings are fine).

### Phase 9 — Advanced business (L)
Accounts/P&L/cash flow, VAT returns (margin scheme), insurance & claims, business rates/utilities, marketing
campaigns, dealership levels 1–6, multi-site management, analytics, property development.
**Done when:** every transaction appears in the accounts; a 30-day sandbox run reconciles exactly (cash = opening + Σ ledger).

#### Phase 9 status
**Code complete** (266 EditMode tests, compile-checked; not run in Unity). Both "done when" points are covered:
every money movement already goes through the ledger (each new cost has its own category), and
`BusinessTests.Sandbox30Days_Reconciles` runs 30 days of buying, selling, fees, VAT, parts, warranties, wages,
insurance, overdraft interest and a loan, checking cash = opening + Σ ledger every day, after the VAT return, and
after compaction. In game, Accounts → *Cash flow* shows the same check live.

| Item | Built |
|---|---|
| Accounts | New views: **Cash flow** (start, trading in/out, operating flow, loans, end, reconciliation, credit rating, overdraft), **Per car** (every sale: price, cost, profit, margin, days in stock, who sold it), **Stock** (days in stock with ageing colours, cost, value, unrealised profit, totals), **VAT**. |
| VAT | Margin scheme (1/6 of each car's profit, never negative) + VAT inside warranty sales − input VAT on parts, labour and auction fees; quarterly return on `QuarterEnded` (refunds paid in automatically), 30 days to pay, then a $200 + 5% fine and -1 reputation. |
| Bank | Credit rating (reputation, net worth, recent overdrawn days) → **overdraft** up to $10,000; spending can use it (`EconomyManager.CanAfford`), 0.06%/day interest; only going past it counts as debt for bankruptcy. |
| Insurance & security | None / Basic (theft and break-ins, $400 excess) / Comprehensive (also forecourt vandalism, $150 excess); weekly premium by stock value, claims in the last year and security. **CCTV & alarm** ($90/week): 60% fewer thefts and vandals, 15% off premiums. New vandalism event; claims pay out automatically. |
| Running costs | Utilities per day and business rates per week for every owned dealership (by size). |
| Marketing | Local paper, online ads (+50% enquiries), social media, signs & flags, local radio: cost per day, footfall boost with diminishing returns (1 - Π(1 - b)), each attracting a buyer type; review stars move footfall (-30% to +20%). |
| Levels 1-6 | Small forecourt → small showroom → medium dealership → large with workshop → premium dealer → dealer group, from cars sold, reputation, staff, workshop jobs, net worth and dealerships owned. Unlocks staff slots (2 to 20) and luxury buyers (level 5, or a premium site). Level-up toast + message. |
| Multi-site | Business → *Sites*: every dealership, ownership, spots used, cars for sale, running costs, GPS. |
| Analytics | Revenue, profit, average margin, days to sell, enquiry conversion, sales by buyer type and body type. |
| Property development | Develop owned investment properties up to level 3 (40% of the price × level; +30% income per level). |

**Phase 9 play-test checklist:**
1. Accounts → Cash flow: "Reconciled". Sell a car: it appears in Per car with its days in stock.
2. Play to the end of a quarter (day 91): a VAT return message; Accounts → VAT: pay it (or let it go late once).
3. Spend below zero: the overdraft works; interest appears next morning.
4. Business → Insurance: take Basic, install CCTV; wait for a break-in/vandal event.
5. Business → Marketing: run online ads for 7 days: more enquiries; radio: luxury buyers.
6. Business → Level: check the next requirement; hire beyond the staff slots (refused).

### Phase 10 — Production readiness (L)
Profiling and optimisation (§11), PlayMode test suite, save-migration test matrix, audio pass, animation polish,
localisation-ready strings table, accessibility (rebinding, subtitles, colour-blind), build pipeline (Windows
first), balancing with the Simulation Configurator sandbox, credits screen from licence records.
**Done when:** release-candidate build runs 2 in-game weeks without errors, meets §11 budgets, passes all tests.

#### Phase 10 status
**Code complete** (283 EditMode tests passing, PlayMode suite compile-checked; nothing run in Unity yet). Of the
"done when" points, *passes all tests* is met for EditMode. The 2-week run is automated
(`GameFlowTests.Soak_FourteenDays_NoErrors_LedgerReconciles`) but has to be run in the Editor, and the §11 budgets
have to be measured on your hardware (Settings → Display → frame-rate overlay, plus the Unity Profiler).

| Item | Built |
|---|---|
| PlayMode suite | `Tests/PlayMode` (Test Runner → PlayMode): scene loads with every service, buy a car online, sleep advances the day, save → change → load restores money/day/cars, test drive starts and ends, 14-day soak with no logged errors and the ledger matching cash every morning. Saves go to a temp folder (`SaveManager.SavesRootOverride`). Skipped if the scene isn't built. |
| Save-migration matrix | EditMode: every old game-module version 1-6 migrates in order to current; saves missing any later module load defaults; a module from a newer game is refused while the rest load; unknown modules survive a round trip with the same checksum. |
| Audio | Sound groups (music, effects, ambience, vehicles, interface) with sliders; **AudioLibrary** asset (`Resources/CarSalesAudioLibrary`) replaces any sound or ambience loop; **AmbienceManager** crossfades street / showroom / workshop / auction-hall beds by where you are, rain on top when wet (muffled indoors), optional music slot. All generated in code until you add clips. |
| Polish | HUD money counts up/down to the new balance. (Broader animation polish is still to do.) |
| Strings table | `Foundation/Localization/Strings` + runtime `Loc.T(key, english)`; `Resources/Localization/en.json` (76 keys: main menu, pause, desktop apps, settings, HUD). Add `xx.json` to add a language (Settings → General → Language). A test checks every key used in code is in en.json, with no duplicates or conflicting texts. Other screens still use plain English. |
| Accessibility | **Key rebinding** (Settings → Controls; saved in PlayerPrefs, reset button; applies to every action including ones resolved by name), **subtitles** for the auctioneer and customers' speech bubbles (Settings → General), **colour-blind-safe theme** (blue/orange instead of green/red). |
| Build pipeline | *Tools → Car Sales → Build → Windows (Release / Development)* → `Builds/Windows[-Dev]/CarForSaleSimulator.exe` with CREDITS.txt and build_info.txt; release builds still refuse assets with unshippable licences. Command line: `-executeMethod CarSales.EditorTools.CarSalesBuild.BuildWindowsRelease`. No CI workflow (the repo has no ProjectSettings/Packages for GameCI to open). |
| Balancing | `Sim/Balance`: Easy / Normal / Hard / Realistic presets (starting money, customer budgets, repair costs, footfall, stock prices) + **Sandbox** that plays a simple dealer with the real buyer model. *Tools → Car Sales → Simulation Configurator* compares presets and a custom set over N days and seeds, and saves `Resources/CarSalesBalance.json` (Difficulty: CUSTOM). A save keeps the difficulty it started with. 30-day average net profit (20 seeds): Easy ≈ $141k, Normal ≈ $72k, Hard ≈ $11k, Realistic ≈ break-even. Tests keep that order and keep Normal profitable but under 3× the starting money. |
| Credits | Main menu and pause menu → Credits: game credits + every imported asset's attribution from the Asset Studio registry. |

**Phase 10 play-test checklist:**
1. Test Runner → PlayMode → Run All (after Build Everything). All pass, including the 14-day soak.
2. Settings → Controls: rebind Interact to F, use it, restart the game: still F. Reset all.
3. Settings → Display → Theme: COLOUR-BLIND SAFE, back to the main menu, load: good/bad are blue/orange.
4. Walk into the auction hall during a sale: subtitles; the ambience changes; rain outside is louder than inside.
5. Settings → Audio: drag each slider; engine and ambience follow.
6. Settings → General → Difficulty: HARD, New Game: less starting money ($30,000); repairs cost more.
7. Tools → Car Sales → Simulation Configurator → Run sandbox. Build → Windows (Development): the game runs from Builds/.
8. Turn on the frame-rate overlay in the busiest spot (dealership + traffic + rain) and compare with §11.

### Phase 11 — Characters & building levels (L, added after Phase 10)
Requested after the release-candidate work: real animated characters (Mixamo) for the player and every kind of AI,
and buildings you upgrade through three visibly different levels.
**Done when:** Character Setup builds a player + AI cast from one Mixamo character and the listed animations, and every
owned building can be taken from level 1 to 3 with its look replaced each time.

#### Phase 11 status
**Code complete** (325 EditMode tests passing, compile-checked; not run in Unity). Fixes first: the MOT lists each part
once, and auction bidders always have different, fitting names.

| Item | Built |
|---|---|
| Character Setup | *Tools → Car Sales → Character Setup*: main character (Mixamo FBX, With Skin), 16 animation slots with the exact Mixamo search for each (Idle, Walk, Run, Talking required; Wave, Point, Look around, Kneel, Raise hand, Clap, Happy, Angry, Thinking, Sitting, Typing, On the phone optional). Files dropped in `Art/Characters/Animations` are matched by name automatically. **Build** makes the rigs Humanoid, sets loops and bakes root motion in place, builds one shared Animator (Speed blend + actions), your player prefab, the AI cast and `CharacterLibrary`, and adds Mixamo licence records. |
| Update popup | On editor load, until characters are set up (or you choose *Don't ask again*), a dialog lists what to download from Mixamo and opens Character Setup. Bumping `CharacterSetup.SetupVersion` (new animations) asks again. |
| AI look-alikes | `VariantGenerator`: from your character (plus any extra Mixamo characters) N variants with different height, build, skin tone, hair/clothes/shoe colours, optional parts (hats, glasses, beards) and body blend shapes; a quarter in staff workwear. Same seed → same cast. **Note:** these share your character's mesh (recoloured/reshaped); new faces need more uploaded characters - the system can't model new people. |
| Animated AI | Customers (look around, kneel at the tyres, think, wave when interested, talk while negotiating, happy/angry when leaving), pedestrians (walk/run), private sellers (wave, talk), the auction room (seated and standing bidders, auctioneer talks and points, hands go up for room bids, clapping on SOLD; you raise your hand when you bid), visible staff at work (receptionist typing, salespeople talking to customers, manager on the phone, mechanics kneeling at the bays during jobs, detailers at the dirtiest car). Missing clips fall back (`CharacterSetup.Resolve`). |
| Player character | Your character on the player; first person shows its shadow, **V** (or Settings → General) switches to a third-person shoulder camera with wall collision and longer reach. |
| Building levels | `Sim/Buildings` + `BuildingManager` (module `buildings`): AUTO WORLD, other dealerships, the service centre, homes and investment properties have levels 1-3. Each level has 3-5 upgrades (AUTO WORLD's are the Upgrades app ones); when the last is bought the game asks to **rebuild** (cost by type/price); builders work overnight (fence, scaffolding, crane, sign) and next morning the building is replaced. Old property developments carry over as levels. |
| New looks | Build Everything makes Level1/2/3 for every building: dealership → two-storey showroom with canopy and totem → flagship glass box with mezzanine, six platforms and rooftop letters; service centre → brick shed with office → clad workshop with canopy, solar roof and EV chargers; each home (trailer → cabin → family house; house → extended → modern with pool; villa → wing + terrace → mansion); apartments/offices → extended → glass tower; car park → 6 decks → 8 decks with screen facade. World Builder dealerships can use imported buildings for levels 2 and 3. NavMesh is rebuilt after a change. |
| What levels give | Dealerships: +4/+8 parking spots, more customers and budgets, reputation, staff slots. Service centre: faster jobs, cheaper repairs. Homes: wake earlier, more energy, reputation. Investments: +30%/+60% income plus upgrades. Buildings app on the computer (and Business → Property links to it). |

**Phase 11 play-test checklist:**
1. Reopen Unity: the character popup appears. Download a Mixamo character + the 4 required animations into the folders, Character Setup → Build.
2. Play: customers, staff and pedestrians use your character's look-alikes and animate; press V for third person.
3. Auction hall during a sale: seated/standing bidders, hands up on room bids, clapping on SOLD.
4. Buildings app: buy the Suburban House's 3 level-1 upgrades → the rebuild question appears → sleep → the house is extended.
5. Upgrades app: buy one level of each upgrade → AUTO WORLD asks to rebuild → next day the two-storey showroom and 4 new lot spots.
6. Old save with a developed Office Tower: it starts at the matching building level.

### Phase 12 — CarForSaleSimV2: master map, V2 interface, release tooling (L)
From the owner's master map and UI board. **Done when:** Build Everything builds the 14-zone master-map town, the
interface follows the UI board (palette, icons, layouts), and a release build is refused until the Release Checklist passes.

#### Phase 12 status
**Code complete** (343 EditMode tests passing, compile-checked; not run in Unity).

| Item | Built |
|---|---|
| Master map (12a) | `Sim/World/TownPlan.cs`: the 14 zones; a 2.8 km test-drive loop (zone 12) round a ~1,040 × 470 m town; Northern Avenue and Dealer Road with five cross roads; seven UK roundabouts (one-way clockwise rings in the traffic graph); traffic lights only at two crossroads by the dealership, the rest give-way. Every site in its zone: home (1), AUTO WORLD (2), auction and used-car market with car park and vehicle storage (3), service centre/MOT (4), mechanic and body shop (5), car wash (6), fuel (7), parts and tyre shop (8), Maple Close and Birch Close sellers (9), town centre terraces with the investments (10), industrial estate (11), park with lake and bandstand (13), Downtown Motors and Luxury Lane on the two expansion plots (14). Countryside fields and hedges round the loop. Tests: zones, sites off roads and reachable, no overlaps, connected network, no dead-end lanes, clockwise roundabouts, pavements never cross roads, loop length. |
| Moving to the new town | Saves remember the town version; on loading an older save, cars parked on old streets go to AUTO WORLD (with a message). World Builder sites placed on the old town get a warning to re-check them. Pedestrians walk the plan's pavements; the world map frames the new town. |
| V2 interface (12b) | Board palette as the default theme; money in £; Material Icons (Apache 2.0) rasterised in code (`Foundation/UI/VectorIcon`, tested). Every window gets a title icon and close cross. Main menu, pause, settings (side nav: Gameplay, Graphics, Audio, Controls, Language; Reset to Default, Apply), HUD (cash pill top-left, weather + clock top-right), phone (coloured app tiles; new Notifications and Missions apps), world map (icon markers, legend), desktop icons, Fuel Station screen (fuel type, price per litre, litres, refuel; wrong fuel refused), customer portrait in negotiation. New settings: invert Y, show hints, auto save, quality, resolution, display mode, V-Sync, frame-rate limit. |
| Release tooling (12c) | Asset Studio > Online: paste Sketchfab links to look them all up (licence, downloadable, real-brand warning). Release Checklist (Tools > Car Sales): characters, licences, car brands, name/company, version, notices; release builds refuse to start with blockers. `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` shipped with builds. |

**Not done / needs you:** the six Sketchfab cars must be downloaded in Unity with your Sketchfab token (this
environment can't reach Sketchfab), and real brands (Mercedes, BMW, Toyota) need renaming and de-badging or a
licence before selling. Characters need Mixamo downloads. The board's photographic images (car photos, the customer
face) are rendered live in game, not copied. Screens not listed above use the new palette and icons but keep their
earlier layouts.

**Phase 12 play-test checklist:**
1. Build Everything; press Play: drive the test-drive loop and every roundabout (traffic goes clockwise).
2. Visit all 14 zones (world map legend); check nothing is inside a building and customers come to AUTO WORLD.
3. Load an old save: parked cars are at AUTO WORLD with a message.
4. Main menu, pause, settings (try every page, Reset to Default), phone apps, Fuel Station, negotiation portrait.
5. Asset Studio > Online: paste your six links, look them up, download one and set it up.
6. Tools > Car Sales > Release Checklist: work through it, then Build > Windows (Release).

### Phase 13 — Realism: surfaces, lighting, interiors (L)
The owner asked for a realistic, detailed town with interiors. **Done when:** every surface has a real texture at its
real size, the game has Low/Medium/High/Ultra graphics with shadows, ambient occlusion and real night lights, the
weather and time of day change the look, the showrooms, workshops and homes are furnished (homes walk-in), every piece
of furniture can be swapped for a real model, and the Realism Checklist lists what is left with live progress.

#### Phase 13 status
**Code complete** (375 EditMode tests passing, compile-checked; not run in Unity).

| Item | Built |
|---|---|
| Surfaces (13a) | `Foundation/Graphics/SurfaceGen.cs`: 24 tiling PBR texture sets made in code (albedo, normal, mask = metal/AO/smoothness, emission): asphalt, concrete, paving, brick, render, grass, porcelain and marble floors, wood, flat roof, roof tiles, cladding, soil, wheat, fabric, brushed metal, foliage, bark, carpet, workshop resin, and three façades (office glass, rendered flats, brick flats) with night-lit windows. Generated once into `Assets/CarSales/GeneratedArt/Surfaces` (git-ignored). `Foundation/Graphics/MetricMesh.cs`: cube/plane/cylinder with UVs in metres, swapped in by Build Everything so textures show at real size (meshes shared by size). Large ground surfaces get a 70 m variation map against tiling. **Surface Library** (*Realism* menu) swaps any surface for a scanned material (Poly Haven / ambientCG). Backdrop buildings get façades, a gravel roof and roof clutter; pitched roofs get clay or slate tiles; premium showrooms marble; workshops resin floors. Tests: tiling seams, determinism, normals, detail, lit-window share, tintable brightness, mesh winding, tangents, metric UVs. |
| Lighting & atmosphere (13b) | `Editor/RealisticGraphics.cs`: four URP tiers copied from your URP asset (originals untouched, Restore available) with shadows 60-260 m, 2-4 cascades, soft shadows, SSAO renderer feature, Forward+, probe blending, HDR grading, MSAA, texture streaming; quality levels Low/Medium/High/Ultra (High default). Post-processing: day profile (ACES, bloom, split-tone, grain, warm balance) plus night and rain profiles. `Sim/World/RealismSim.cs` (tested): darkness, golden hour, haze, fog colour, street-light switching, window glow, wetness. `Scripts/World/RealismDirector.cs`: lit windows at night, lamp heads and signs dim by day, a pool of real lamp lights moved to the nearest lamps (6-24 by quality), headlights on the car you drive, night/rain volume weights. `WorldManager`: wet roads, pavements, roofs and brick darker and shinier, drying over ~2 game hours; haze and fog coloured by time of day. Car paint and imported car paint use Complex Lit clear coat. Debug F2 (+1 hour), F4 (next weather). |
| Interiors (13c) | `Editor/CarSalesInteriors.cs`: furniture kit (sofas, armchairs, coffee/dining tables, chairs, office chairs, desks with monitors, beds, nightstands with lamps, wardrobes, bookcases, kitchens, islands, fridges, TV walls, floor lamps, plants, rugs, wall art, reception counters, coffee points, brochure stands, tool chests, workbenches, tyre racks, racking, tube lights). Every piece is a `PlaceholderSlot` (new kinds Sofa...WorkshopKit) so Asset Studio > Town can swap in real models (Interior assets). `Sim/World/InteriorPlan.cs` holds the layouts (tested: no overlaps, inside the walls, clear of car platforms, door-to-bed and customer-to-car paths). Showrooms (3 levels), service centre, mechanic workshop and parts shop refurnished. **Walk-in homes**: `HomeInterior`, `InteriorDoor`, `InteriorBed`; the front door takes you inside (built under the house), you sleep in the bed and wake beside it; fog, rain, street lights and ambience are turned down indoors. |
| Checklist & guide (13d) | `Studio/Core/RealismChecklist.cs` (tested) + *Tools > Car Sales > Realism > Realism Checklist*: score, next step and a button per step (graphics, sky, cars, scanned textures, characters, town models, furniture, sound, licences). `docs/REALISM_GUIDE.md`: every step, sources, licences, troubleshooting. |

**Not done / needs you:** the realistic models themselves (cars, people, buildings, trees, furniture) and sounds must
be downloaded in Unity from the sources in the guide (this environment can't reach them, and licences need your
account). Colours, brightness and fog density are a first pass that has not been seen on screen. Baked global
illumination (light probes / APV) is not set up: everything is real-time.

**Phase 13 play-test checklist:**
1. Build Everything (the first time it also makes the graphics levels): Project Settings > Quality lists Low-Ultra.
2. Play: look at roads, pavements, brick, grass and building fronts close up and far away (no stretched or tiny textures).
3. F2 until night: windows light up, lamps light the street near you, headlights on the car you drive.
4. F4 to rain: roads darken and shine, then dry slowly; fog and haze look right at dawn, noon, dusk and night.
5. Walk into AUTO WORLD at each building level (Buildings app) and check customers still reach every car.
6. Go home: E at the front door, walk to the bed, sleep after 18:00, wake beside it, E on the inside of the door.
7. Realism Checklist and Surface Library: drop a Poly Haven asphalt in, Apply, see it in Play mode.
8. Each graphics level: frame-rate overlay; Restore Original Graphics and Apply again both work.

## 10. Testing strategy

| Level | Tool | What | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compile check | dotnet + Unity reference assemblies (my side) | Everything compiles | Every change |
| EditMode unit tests | Unity Test Framework (NUnit) | Pure Sim/Core logic: ledger, VAT, valuation, faults, repairs, auction increments/fees/AI bids, negotiation, loans, save round-trip, migrations, plate/VIN uniqueness | Every phase; you run *Test Runner → EditMode → Run All* |
| PlayMode smoke tests | Unity Test Framework | Load test scene, spawn & drive a car 5 s (speed > 10 km/h), park on a spot, buy a car, sleep → day advances, save → reload → same state | Phase 2 onward |
| Sandbox simulation | Simulation Configurator | 30 game-days headless with scripted strategies → P&L sanity bounds | Phase 7 onward |
| Manual checklist | You | Per-phase play-test list (in each phase's PR/commit notes) | End of each phase |
| CI (optional) | GameCI GitHub Actions (needs a Unity licence secret) | Run EditMode tests on every push | After GitHub repo exists, if you want it |

Testability rule: if a feature can't be tested without the Editor, its logic is in the wrong layer (R3).

## 11. Performance budgets

Target hardware: GTX 1660 / RX 5600 class GPU, 6-core CPU, 16 GB RAM, 1080p, Medium preset.

| Metric | Budget |
|---|---|
| Frame rate | 60 fps average, 1% low ≥ 45 fps in the busiest area (dealership + traffic + rain) |
| CPU main thread | ≤ 12 ms |
| Memory | ≤ 4 GB total, ≤ 2.5 GB textures/meshes |
| Draw calls (SRP batches) | ≤ 2,500 in town view |
| Vehicles with full physics | Player car + test-drive car + ≤ 2 others; traffic uses simplified kinematic movement |
| Traffic / pedestrians | ≤ 30 cars / ≤ 40 pedestrians active, LOD'd AI updates (far agents tick at 2–5 Hz) |
| Imported vehicle | LOD0 ≤ 150k tris, ≤ 8 materials; building LOD0 ≤ 300k tris |
| Load times | Town load ≤ 20 s HDD / 8 s SSD; save ≤ 200 ms (off the main thread where possible) |

## 12. Asset licensing policy

`LicenceRecord { source, sourceUrl, author, licenceType, licenceUrl, attribution, commercialUse, modificationsAllowed,
redistributionRestricted, purchaseRef, dateAcquired, notes }`

| Licence type | Prototype | Release build |
|---|---|---|
| CC0 / Public domain | ✅ | ✅ |
| CC-BY | ✅ | ✅ with attribution in credits (auto-generated) |
| CC-BY-SA | ✅ | ⚠️ allowed only after review (share-alike applies to the asset) |
| CC-BY-NC / CC-BY-NC-SA / Editorial | ✅ (flagged) | ❌ blocked |
| Asset Store Standard EULA | ✅ | ✅ (asset must not be redistributed as source) |
| Purchased royalty-free (KitBash3D, CGTrader, Fab...) | ✅ | ✅ per the record's terms |
| Unknown | ⚠️ flagged | ❌ blocked |

Real car brands, logos and model names are trademarks: imported cars get **fictional** names/badges in game data
(v4 already uses Kestrel, Orion, Titan, Vortex, Aurelia). Asset Studio has a "remove/replace badges" checklist item.

## 13. Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Code is written without running Unity on my side | Bugs found late | Phase 0 first; small phases; your Console reports after each phase; PlayMode smoke tests |
| WheelCollider handling feels bad | Core experience | Physics profiles + telemetry test track; Arcade fallback stays |
| Imported models vary wildly | Asset Studio can't auto-detect everything | Manual correction screen is a first-class feature, not an afterthought |
| Scope (10 phases, XL items) | Never finishing | Each phase is shippable; V5.0 can release after Phase 7 with Phases 8–10 as 5.x updates |
| Save format churn | Broken saves | Module versions + migration tests with fixture saves from each phase |
| Licences | Legal | §12 validator blocks release builds |
| Performance with imported high-poly assets | Low fps | Tri budgets enforced at Asset Studio validation; LODs; profiling each phase from Phase 4 |
