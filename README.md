# Car For Sale Simulator — Unity Project (v4.0 "Open Town")

A car-dealership life simulator for **Unity 6 (URP)**. You live in a small trailer, drive your own beat-up car to work,
buy cars online, at the **Used Car Market** or at the **Auction Center**, fix them at the **Mechanic Workshop**,
wash them at the **Car Wash**, fuel up at the **Fuel Station**, sell them at your dealerships, buy **more showrooms,
houses and investment properties** — and go home to **sleep** to end each day.
Reach a **$1,000,000** net worth to win (or go bankrupt trying).

**v4.0 adds** a whole town (roads, 10+ locations), driving any car you own (fuel, mileage, crashes), tow trucks & taxis,
live auctions vs. AI bidders, a walk-around used car lot, 3 dealerships, homes & properties, a real 24-hour day with
energy and sleeping, night lighting, a town map with GPS, and a phone. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

**V5.0 in progress.** The full development blueprint (architecture, script-by-script plan, phases, tests) is in
[docs/V5_MASTER_SPEC.md](docs/V5_MASTER_SPEC.md). Phase 1 is in: 3 save slots with automatic backups, a bank
account statement of every transaction, and automated tests (*Window → General → Test Runner → EditMode → Run All*).
Phase 2 adds **realistic driving** (wheel physics, engine and automatic gearbox, ABS/traction/stability control, a
different feel per car class) and **~45 individual car parts** behind the 6 condition bars. *Settings → Physics*
switches back to the old arcade handling; *Tools → Car Sales → Vehicle Studio* shows and tunes each car's performance.
Phase 2b adds a **test track** (*Tools → Car Sales → 5. Open Test Track*, or **Drive** in Vehicle Studio) that measures
0-100 km/h, braking distance and cornering g, a **manual gearbox** option, **visible dents**, and an **All parts** view.
Phase 3 adds the **Asset Studio** (*Tools → Car Sales → Asset Studio*): import real 3D cars, buildings, props and
characters (FBX, OBJ, GLB/glTF...), fix their scale and materials, set up wheels and paint, record their licence, and
approve them into the game. Imported cars go on sale and can be driven. Release builds refuse assets whose licence
doesn't allow a commercial game. **If this repository is public, don't commit paid assets.**
Its **Online** tab searches and downloads Sketchfab models (with your own API token) and Poly Haven skies and
materials; imported characters can walk around as customers.
Phase 4a adds **themes** (Dark / Light / High contrast / custom), an **interface size** setting, window animations,
a new **phone** with apps, and **post-processing + HDRI sky** lighting. Phase 4b redesigns the **HUD**, turns the
dealer computer into a **desktop** (with an **Accounts** app), adds a tabbed **vehicle file**, a filterable
**marketplace**, a full-screen **map** with routes, a cinematic **main menu**, and lets you swap the town's
placeholder buildings, trees, lamps and benches for your imported models (Asset Studio → *Town*).
Phase 5a adds **hidden faults**, **step-by-step inspections** (walk-around, interior, bonnet, scanner, road test,
lift, history check), **paperwork and history** (logbook, keys, MOT, service book, write-offs, finance, clocking),
**MOT tests**, and a **Workshop** app for parts and repairs. Phase 5b adds your own **service centre** (lift, tyre and MOT bays),
**hands-on** inspections and repairs (hold E on markers), a **Workshop Board**, a hireable **mechanic** and the
**Parts Direct** counter in town. Phase 6 rebuilds the **auctions**: a calendar of hall, online and salvage
sales, a walk-in sale hall where you raise your paddle (E), a viewing yard, AI bidders with personalities, proxy
bids, invoices with fees and VAT, and collection from the car park. Phase 7a adds a **living market** with competitors and trade batches, **nine
kinds of buyer**, negotiation with **trade-ins, finance and fault disclosure**, **reviews and a CRM**, and **staff**
(salespeople, mechanics, detailers, drivers) who work without you. Phase 7b adds **private sellers** you visit at their houses, a **listing
editor** with photos and online enquiries, customer **questions and test drives**, **paperwork and warranties**, and
receptionist and manager staff. Phase 8a brings the town to life: **weather**, Sunday hours and bank holidays,
fuel prices, random events, **traffic with lights**, **pedestrians**, and the **World Builder** for adding your own
dealerships (also inside imported buildings). Phase 8b lets you **draw roads** (with junctions, trees and lamps), place
**workshops, car washes, fuel stations, houses and apartments**, put imported interiors in showrooms, and keeps the
frame rate up (traffic setting, overlay, automatic thinning). Phase 9 adds **proper books**: cash flow, profit per car, stock ageing, **VAT returns**
(margin scheme), an **overdraft**, **insurance**, running costs, **marketing campaigns**, **dealership levels 1-6**,
analytics and property development. Phase 10 gets it ready to ship: **settings tabs** with **key rebinding**, subtitles and a
**colour-blind theme**, **sound groups and ambience**, **difficulty presets** (with the Simulation Configurator sandbox),
a **credits** screen, **one-click Windows builds** (*Tools → Car Sales → Build*), a strings table for translations, and a
**PlayMode test suite** (*Window → General → Test Runner → PlayMode*). Phase 11 adds **animated Mixamo characters**
(*Tools → Car Sales → Character Setup*: your character becomes the player and an AI cast; V = third person) and
**building levels 1-3**: buy a building's upgrades, then rebuild it overnight into a completely new, bigger building
(computer → **Buildings**). Phase 12 (**CarForSaleSimV2**) rebuilds the town to the **master map** (14 zones round a
test-drive loop with roundabouts), restyles the whole interface to the **V2 UI board** (icons, colours, new menus,
settings, HUD, phone, fuel station), and adds a **Release Checklist** (*Tools → Car Sales*) that must pass before a
Steam release build. Phase 13 (**Realism**) puts **real textures on every surface**, adds **Low–Ultra graphics levels**
(shadows, ambient occlusion, real street lamps and headlights at night, wet roads in the rain, haze), **furnished
interiors** and **walk-in homes**, and a **Realism Checklist** (*Tools → Car Sales → Realism*).
**To make the game look real, follow [docs/REALISM_GUIDE.md](docs/REALISM_GUIDE.md)** (every step, all free sources).

> **Updating from an older version?** Close Unity. Copy this project's `Assets` folder over your project's `Assets`
> folder and let it **overwrite** files (don't delete folders first — Unity's hidden `.meta` files must survive).
> Reopen Unity, then run **Tools → Car Sales → 2. Build Everything**. Older saves still load (you'll wake up at home).

## 1. Quick start (about 5 minutes)

1. **Install Unity 6 LTS** with Unity Hub (https://unity.com/download).
2. In Unity Hub: **New project → "Universal 3D" (URP) template** → name it `CarSalesSim` → Create.
   Then **close Unity**.
3. Copy the **`Assets`** folder from this zip **into your new project folder**, merging it with the
   existing `Assets` folder. You should end up with `CarSalesSim/Assets/CarSales/...`.
4. Open the project again in Unity.
5. If a **"Car Sales Simulator – packages are required"** dialog appears, click **Install**.
   - If Unity asks *"enable the new Input System backends?"*, click **Yes**. The editor restarts.
   - No dialog? The packages are already there. You can always run **Tools → Car Sales → 1. Check & Install Packages**.
6. **Tools → Car Sales → 2. Build Everything**.
   - The first time, it may ask you to import **TextMeshPro Essentials**: click *Import TMP Essentials*,
     then run **Build Everything** again.
7. The scene `Assets/CarSales/Generated/Scenes/DealershipTest.unity` opens. **Press Play** to jump straight in.
   For the full flow (main menu → game), open **Tools → Car Sales → 4. Open Main Menu Scene** and press Play.
   For a build, both scenes are already in Build Settings (MainMenu first).

> You don't build anything by hand: the wizard generates all materials, the 8 car models, the car data,
> the prefabs, every UI panel and the test scene. Run it again any time to rebuild the `Generated` folder.

## 3. How to play

Follow the **GOAL** at the top-left — it teaches the game step by step and pays cash rewards.

1. **Morning:** you wake up at home (Starter Trailer). Your own car is on the driveway — stand next to it, press **F**.
   Press **M** and set the GPS to **AUTO WORLD**.
2. **Dealerships open 08:00–20:00** automatically. Customers only come during opening hours, only to dealerships you own,
   and only look at cars **listed for sale on a dealership spot**.
3. **Buy cars** — online at the office computer (+$300 delivery), at the **Used Car Market** (cheaper, free inspection,
   drive it away yourself) or at the **Auction Center** (10:00–17:00, cheapest but condition unknown!).
4. **Fix them** — drive (or tow, **P**) a car into the **Mechanic Workshop** bays and talk to the mechanic, or use the
   car menu → *Repair* (it offers a tow). Same for the **Car Wash**. Fuel up at the **Fuel Station** (E at the pumps).
5. **Sell** — park the car on a dealership spot (drive up to a free spot, press **E**), set a price, haggle with customers.
6. **Evening:** after 18:00 go home and **sleep at your front door**. Rent, loan interest and property income are settled,
   you get the daily report, the game saves. Stay up past **02:00** and you pass out (fine + less energy).
7. **Grow:** upgrades, a second and third dealership (Downtown Motors, Luxury Lane), better homes (wake earlier,
   +reputation), and investment properties that pay every night (computer → **Real Estate**, or the FOR SALE signs).
8. **Win** at $1,000,000 net worth (cash + cars + 80% of properties − loan). **Lose** after 3 nights in debt.

## 5. Moving it into a city project (short version)

Full steps are in [docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md → Moving into a city](docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md#8-moving-into-a-city-project).

1. Use the **same Unity version and render pipeline** (URP ↔ URP).
2. Right-click `Assets/CarSales` → **Export Package…** → import the `.unitypackage` into the city project
   (or just copy the folder).
3. In the city project: install the packages (the installer dialog appears), set **Layer 20 = `Interactable`**, then:
   - drag **`CarSalesSystems.prefab`** and **`Dealership.prefab`** into the city scene,
   - add **`PlayerInteractor`** + **`MenuInputBlocker`** to the city's player,
   - bake a **NavMeshSurface** around the dealership,
   - keep only **one EventSystem** (with *Input System UI Input Module*).

## 6. Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| No **Tools → Car Sales** menu | Check the Console for errors. Run *1. Check & Install Packages*. |
| Only "1. Check & Install Packages" in the menu | Packages are missing, so the game scripts are switched off. Install them. |
| Pink materials | You're not on URP (or HDRP). Use the *Universal 3D* template. |
| Customers don't move | NavMesh missing: select `Environment` → *NavMeshSurface* → **Bake**. (The runtime baker also bakes it if empty.) |
| Customers never come | You must **list** at least one car (car menu → Set Price → List for Sale) and **open** the shop (O). |
| No interaction prompt | The object isn't on Layer 20 *Interactable*, or the Player's *PlayerInteractor* mask isn't set. |
| UI buttons don't click | The EventSystem must use **Input System UI Input Module**. |
| Mouse is stuck / visible | Click inside the Game view. Esc closes menus. |
| Old save after changes | Press **F12** in Play mode (deletes the active slot), or **Tools → Car Sales → Delete All Saves**. |
| "Save recovered" message | The latest save file was damaged; the game loaded the newest good backup. Nothing to do. |

## 7. Verification notes

- All C# was compiled against Unity's real `UnityEngine` (2021.3 modules) and `UnityEditor` reference assemblies,
  with stand-in stubs for the UI / TextMeshPro / Input System / AI Navigation packages, and compiles with 0 errors.
- The project has **not** been opened in the Unity Editor itself (no editor was available when it was made).
  If anything fails on your Unity version, the Console message and the
  [troubleshooting table](#6-troubleshooting) should point straight to it.

Car brands and names (Kestrel, Orion, Titan, Vortex, Aurelia) are fictional placeholders.
