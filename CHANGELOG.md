# Changelog

## v5.0-rc4 — Phase 13 "Realism"
- **Real textures on every surface**: asphalt, paving slabs, concrete, brick, painted walls, grass, porcelain and marble
  floors, wood, roof tiles, metal cladding and more, all at their real size. Background buildings have real fronts
  with windows, and rooftop air-con units, lift housings and water tanks.
- **Surface Library** (*Tools > Car Sales > Realism*): swap any surface for a scanned texture from Poly Haven or ambientCG.
- **Graphics levels Low / Medium / High / Ultra**: soft long shadows, ambient occlusion, many real lights (Forward+),
  HDR colour grading, texture streaming. Build Everything sets them up once; *Restore Original Graphics* undoes it.
- **Night**: windows light up building by building, street lamps light the road near you, your car has headlights,
  signs glow; night and rain have their own colour grading.
- **Weather and air**: wet roads, pavements and roofs go dark and shiny and dry slowly; morning mist, golden-hour haze.
- **Clear-coat car paint**, also on cars you import.
- **Furnished interiors**: showrooms (reception, lounge, sales desks, coffee point), workshops (tool chests, workbenches,
  tyre racks, strip lights) and the parts shop. Every piece can be replaced by a real model (*Asset Studio > Town*).
- **Walk-in homes**: go inside your home, sleep in your bed and wake up beside it.
- **Realism Checklist** with live progress, and a full step-by-step guide: `docs/REALISM_GUIDE.md`.
- Debug keys: **F2** one hour later, **F4** next weather.
- 32 new tests (375 total).

## v5.0-rc3 — Phase 12 "CarForSaleSimV2"

  **roundabouts**, a park with a lake, a town centre, an industrial estate, two private-seller closes and two
  expansion plots. Old saves move cars parked on old streets to the dealership.
- **V2 interface** following the UI board: new colours, **icons everywhere**, new main menu, pause menu,
  settings (graphics, gameplay, audio, controls, language, reset), HUD layout, phone apps (**Notifications**,
  **Missions**), world map legend, **Fuel Station** screen, customer portraits. Money is now in **£**.

  animations (found automatically), and a popup after updating tells you exactly what to download.
- **Your character** in the game, with a **third-person view (V)**.
- **AI cast made from your character**: different heights, builds, skin tones, hair and clothes, hats and glasses;
  staff in workwear. Add more Mixamo characters for more faces.
- Customers, pedestrians, sellers, staff and the **auction room** now move and gesture (look round cars, kneel at
  tyres, wave, talk, bid, clap, cheer or storm off).
- **Your staff are visible** at work: reception, showroom, workshop bays, the lot.
- **Building levels 1-3** for dealerships, the service centre, homes and investment properties: buy each level's
  upgrades, then rebuild - builders work overnight and the building is **completely replaced** by a bigger one,
  with more spots, customers, income or comfort. New **Buildings** app.

  building, and validate every site. Your sites survive Build Everything.
- 8 new tests (257 total).

## v5.0-dev — Phase 7b "Sourcing & selling"
- **Private sellers**: classified ads, viewings at houses on Maple Close, questions (they may lie), inspection,
  a drive round the block, haggling, logbook handover.
- **Listing editor**: photos from six angles, honest highlights, a price helper against market and rivals, online
  adverts that bring enquiries - customers who come to view a specific car.
- **Customers** walk round the car, ask questions you answer honestly or not, and take **test drives** (with you or alone).
- **Paperwork & handover** with a **warranty** add-on (and later claims).
- New staff roles: **receptionist** and **manager**.
- 6 new tests (249 total).

## v5.0-dev — Phase 7a "Market, customers, staff"
- **Living market**: prices drift daily, seasons (sports cars in summer, SUVs in winter), demand and supply.
- **Competitor dealers** you can compare your prices with, and weekly **trade batches** from other dealers.
- **Nine kinds of buyer** who judge each car on price, condition, mileage, age, history, economy and paperwork.
- **Negotiation 2.0**: buyers spot faults, you can disclose them, **trade-ins** and **finance** (with commission).
- **Reviews** after every sale (honesty matters - hidden faults bring complaints) and a **Customers** app (CRM).
- **Staff**: hire salespeople, mechanics, detailers and drivers; weekly wages, skills, morale, sick days.
  Salespeople close deals with customers you don't reach; mechanics work the workshop board.
- New apps: Market, Customers, Staff.

## v5.0-dev — Phase 6 "Auctions"
- **Auction calendar** with five sale types: dealer, fleet, salvage, repossession (hall) and timed online sales.
- **Walk-in sale hall**: lots roll onto the stage, the auctioneer calls *going once, going twice, sold*, and you bid by
  raising your paddle (E). Absentee bids work when you're not there.
- **Viewing yard** with numbered bays: read the condition report, inspect the car, check its history, leave a bid.
- **Online sales** with maximum (proxy) bids, outbid notifications and soft close.
- **AI bidders** with personalities (traders, exporters, breakers, mechanics, franchise and private buyers) who bid
  from the condition report.
- **Buyer accounts** (refundable deposit), **invoices** with buyer's premium, internet fee and VAT, late fees,
  cancellation, storage, collection from the car park.
- Auctions app on the computer and phone.
- 11 new tests (232 total).

## v5.0-dev — Phase 5b "Your own workshop"
- **AUTO WORLD Service Centre** next to your dealership: mechanical bay with a lift, tyre bay, MOT bay.
- **Hands-on work**: walk around a car and hold E on glowing markers to inspect it (wheels, bonnet, interior,
  OBD port, underneath on the lift) or to repair it bolt by bolt. Faster and safer than quick DIY.
- **Workshop Board**: waiting for parts → ready → in progress → done, on the wall and in the Workshop app.
- **Hire a mechanic** who works through the board during the day.
- **Parts Direct** counter in town: 10% cheaper, take the parts with you.
- Free MOT tests at your own MOT bay.
- 7 new tests (221 total).

## v5.0-dev — Phase 5a "Inspection, workshop, documents"
- **Hidden faults**: 40 kinds (misfires, head gaskets, slipping clutches, worn pads, rust, smoker's cars...). Worn cars
  have more; they get worse every day and lower the value.
- **Inspect step by step**: walk-around, interior, under the bonnet, OBD scanner, road test (drive 1 km), lift,
  history check, or pay for a full inspection. Each finds different faults; you get better with practice.
- **Paperwork & history**: plate and VIN, logbook, keys, MOT, service history; history check for write-offs (Cat N/S),
  outstanding finance (the lender can take the car!) and clocked mileage.
- **MOT tests** with fails and advisories.
- **Workshop app**: parts in three qualities from three suppliers, repair jobs at the garage or do it yourself,
  jobs in progress, MOT and paperwork (replacement logbook, locksmith, settle finance).
- Vehicle file **Documents** and **History** tabs are live; marketplace cards show *No logbook* / *MOT expired*.
- 21 new tests (214 total).

## v5.0-dev — Phase 4b "Screens"
- **HUD** is minimal: clock and shop status, cash (with +/- pops), slim GPS, smaller minimap; speed/gear/fuel only
  while driving; prompts show their key; **H** shows the controls. The HUD hides while menus are open.
- **Dealer computer** is a desktop: app icons, widgets (clock, today, goal, messages), taskbar. New **Accounts** app
  (profit & loss by period, profit-per-day chart, sortable transactions).
- **Vehicle file** with tabs: Overview, Condition, Documents (coming in phase 5), History, Costs (break-even), Listing.
  Open it for your own cars too (My Cars → *File*, car menu → *Vehicle file*).
- **Marketplace**: filter sidebar, *Best deal* sort, grid or list view, deal and verified badges.
- **Map**: full screen with filters, zoom, click-to-GPS and the route drawn along the roads.
- **Main menu**: cinematic camera; save slots show a screenshot.
- **Esc goes back** (phone app → home, computer app → desktop, vehicle file → where you came from).
- **Reflection probes** in showrooms.
- **Your models in the town**: Asset Studio → *Town* swaps backdrop buildings, trees, lamps and benches for models you
  imported; Build Everything keeps them.
- New UI components (tabs, sortable table, dialogs, stat tiles, charts); the colour lint also catches `<color=#..>`.
- 4 new tests (193 total).

## v5.0-dev — Phase 4a "Design system & lighting"
- **Themes**: Dark (original), Light, High contrast and a Custom theme asset; every colour in the UI now comes from the
  theme (a test enforces it). Button text adapts automatically for contrast.
- **Interface size** setting (80-130%), applied immediately.
- Windows **fade in**; gamepad users get the first button selected.
- **New phone**: home screen with clock, date, notifications and apps (Messages, Bank, Tow truck, Taxi, Map, My cars,
  Market, Real estate, Settings). Bank, Tow, Taxi and Messages work right on the phone.
- **Lighting**: URP post-processing (ACES tonemapping, bloom, colour grading, vignette, anti-aliasing) on all cameras;
  your newest Poly Haven sky is used automatically; the sky darkens at night and ambient light follows it.
- 2 new tests (189 total).

## v5.0-dev — Phase 3b "Online sources & characters"
- Asset Studio **Online** tab:
  - **Sketchfab**: search downloadable models (thumbnails, author, licence and whether it can ship), then
    *Download & set up* with your own API token. The licence record is filled in automatically.
  - **Poly Haven** (CC0): skies (HDRI → sky material, *Use as sky*) and materials (URP Lit with normal,
    AO and metallic-smoothness maps).
- **Characters as customers**: humanoid setup, idle/walk animations found automatically (e.g. Mixamo),
  an animator is generated; customers spawn looking like your imported characters.
- **Buildings** get a function and an Entrance marker (working sites come with the World Builder).
- **LODs** from `_LOD0/_LOD1` meshes; import-time mesh LODs where Unity supports them.
- **Preview in scene** with a 1.80 m person for scale.
- 30 new tests (187 total).

## v5.0-dev — Phase 3a "Asset Studio"
- **Asset Studio** (*Tools → Car Sales → Asset Studio*): bring external models into the game.
  - Import from a file, drag & drop, the Drop folder (`Assets/CarSales/Art/_Drop`) or any model in the project.
  - Measures triangles, meshes, materials and size; guesses the scale (cm/mm/inch mix-ups) and orientation
    (Z-up exports, sideways models); everything can be adjusted.
  - *Fix materials for URP*: pink Built-in materials become URP Lit; missing textures are found by file name.
  - Cars: wheels detected by name and position (or picked by hand), paint materials chosen, car data entered →
    a drivable car prefab and a car definition that appears for sale. *Drive on test track* button.
  - Buildings, props, interiors and characters get colliders (and an Animator for characters).
  - Every import needs a **licence record**; release builds refuse non-commercial / unknown licences, development
    builds only warn; `CREDITS.txt` is generated (button, and next to every build).
  - Library: versions with **Roll back** and **Remove**.
- Car paint works on imported models (several material slots, URP / glTF / Built-in colour properties).
- Cars in `Assets/CarSales/Data/Cars` (imports) are kept when you run Build Everything.
- 53 new tests (157 total).

## v5.0-dev — Test track fix
- The test track no longer depends on its scene references: the car database now lives in
  `Generated/Resources/CarSalesDatabase.asset` and is found automatically, input falls back to the default keys.
- Build Everything re-opens the saved test track scene and repairs any links that were lost (and logs which).
- The "input action is not linked" warning now points to *Tools → Car Sales → Re-link Input Actions*.

## v5.0-dev — Phase 2b "Test Track"
- **Test track** scene (built by Build Everything; *Tools → Car Sales → 5. Open Test Track*): long straight with
  distance boards, braking zone, slalom, bumps, skid pad, ramp and knock-over cones. Measures 0-100 km/h, braking
  distance, top speed and cornering g, next to the simulated figures. Switch car (N/B), condition (1-4),
  physics (G), gearbox (M), reset (R). Vehicle Studio: **Drive** button for each car.
- **Manual gearbox** option (Settings): Left Shift / Left Ctrl or gamepad bumpers; reverse from 1st at a standstill;
  over-revving downshifts are refused.
- **Dents**: damaged body panels now show as dents at the front, rear, sides or roof - on parked, listed and driven
  cars. Repairing the body removes them.
- **All parts** view (Inspection → All parts): every component with its condition, and how the car's condition
  changes power, brakes, grip and shocks.
- 10 new tests (104 total).

## v5.0-dev — Phase 2a "Vehicle Framework"
**Driving**
- **Realistic driving**: every car now drives on wheel physics (Rigidbody + 4 WheelColliders) with suspension,
  anti-roll bars, weight and grip. Front-, rear- or four-wheel drive depending on the car.
- **Engine and automatic gearbox**: torque curves, up/down shifts, kick-down, rev limiter, engine braking, reverse gear.
  Electric cars: instant torque, one gear, regenerative braking.
- **Driver aids**: ABS, traction control, stability control (each can be switched off in Settings).
- **10 handling classes** (city hatch, family hatch, sedan, sports sedan, SUV, pickup, van, sports, luxury, electric
  hatch) with realistic 0-100 km/h times and top speeds; petrol/diesel/hybrid/electric variants.
- Controls: S brakes and reverses when stopped, **Space = handbrake**, **C = camera** (chase / far / bonnet), **F3 = telemetry**.
- HUD speedometer shows the gear and goes up to 200 km/h. Engine sound pitched by rpm.
- *Settings → Physics: Arcade* brings back the v4 handling. Cars that can't be set up fall back to it automatically.

**Car condition**
- The 6 condition bars are now made of **~45 individual parts** (engine internals, timing belt, oil, each brake
  pad set, shocks, each tyre, each body panel, paint, glass, 12V battery...). Electric cars have a traction battery,
  motor and inverter instead of an engine. Old saves convert automatically.
- **Condition affects driving**: a worn engine is slower, worn pads brake later, bald tyres slide, worn shocks bounce,
  bad alignment pulls to one side, a dead battery means the car won't start.
- **Crashes damage the side that was hit** (front, rear, left, right, roof, underside). Driving wears parts (tyres, pads, oil...).
- Fuel use depends on how hard you drive.
- The inspection report lists the parts in the worst shape.

**Tools**
- **Vehicle Studio** (*Tools → Car Sales → Vehicle Studio*): each car's class, mass, 0-100, top speed and braking;
  "Make editable" creates a physics profile you can tune in the Inspector (kept when you Build Everything).
- 47 new tests (94 total).

## v5.0-dev — Phase 1 "Foundation"
**Saves**
- **3 save slots** (Main Menu → New Game / Load Game), each with **3 automatic backups**.
- Crash-safe writing: a save is written to a temp file and only then replaces the old one.
- Checksums: a damaged save loads the newest good backup instead ("Save recovered" message).
- Damaged values (NaN fuel, duplicate car ids, missing lists) are repaired on load.
- Your v4 save is moved into slot 1 automatically - nothing is lost.
- *Tools → Car Sales → Delete All Saves* replaces *Delete Save File*.

**Money**
- Every money movement is recorded in a **ledger** with a category (car sales, repairs, fuel, rent, loans...).
- Computer → **Bank** now has an **Account statement** (last 40 transactions, today's in/out, balance).
- The morning report shows where yesterday's money came from and went.

**Calendar**
- Weeks and quarters: the HUD clock shows the weekday (Day 1 is a Monday). Weekly/quarterly events are ready for wages and VAT later.

**Under the hood**
- New engine-free `CarSales.Foundation` assembly (EventBus, Ledger, GameCalendar, save store).
- First automated tests: 47 EditMode tests (*Window → General → Test Runner*). The installer now adds the Test Framework package.
